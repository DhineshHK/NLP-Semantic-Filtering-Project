38721977,Chest CT-based automated vertebral fracture assessment using artificial intelligence and morphologic features,"Nadeem SA, Comellas AP, Regan EA, Hoffman EA, Saha PK.",Med Phys. 2024 Jun;51(6):4201-4218. doi: 10.1002/mp.17072. Epub 2024 May 9.,Nadeem SA,Med Phys,2024,2024/05/09,,,10.1002/mp.17072,"BACKGROUND: Spinal degeneration and vertebral compression fractures are common among the elderly that adversely affect their mobility, quality of life, lung function, and mortality. Assessment of vertebral fractures in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is important due to the high prevalence of osteoporosis and associated vertebral fractures in COPD.
PURPOSE: We present new automated methods for (1) segmentation and labelling of individual vertebrae in chest computed tomography (CT) images using deep learning (DL), multi-parametric freeze-and-grow (FG) algorithm, and separation of apparently fused vertebrae using intensity autocorrelation and (2) vertebral deformity fracture detection using computed vertebral height features and parametric computational modelling of an established protocol outlined for trained human experts.
METHODS: A chest CT-based automated method was developed for quantitative deformity fracture assessment following the protocol by Genant et al. The computational method was accomplished in the following steps: (1) computation of a voxel-level vertebral body likelihood map from chest CT using a trained DL network; (2) delineation and labelling of individual vertebrae on the likelihood map using an iterative multi-parametric FG algorithm; (3) separation of apparently fused vertebrae in CT using intensity autocorrelation; (4) computation of vertebral heights using contour analysis on the central anterior-posterior (AP) plane of a vertebral body; (5) assessment of vertebral fracture status using ratio functions of vertebral heights and optimized thresholds. The method was applied to inspiratory or total lung capacity (TLC) chest scans from the multi-site Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00608764) study, and the performance was examined (n = 3231). One hundred and twenty scans randomly selected from this dataset were partitioned into training (n = 80) and validation (n = 40) datasets for the DL-based vertebral body classifier. Also, generalizability of the method to low dose CT imaging (n = 236) was evaluated.
RESULTS: The vertebral segmentation module achieved a Dice score of .984 as compared to manual outlining results as reference (n = 100); the segmentation performance was consistent across images with the minimum and maximum of Dice scores among images being .980 and .989, respectively. The vertebral labelling module achieved 100% accuracy (n = 100). For low dose CT, the segmentation module produced image-level minimum and maximum Dice scores of .995 and .999, respectively, as compared to standard dose CT as the reference; vertebral labelling at low dose CT was fully consistent with standard dose CT (n = 236). The fracture assessment method achieved overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.3%, 94.8%, and 98.5%, respectively, for 40,050 vertebrae from 3231 COPDGene participants. For generalizability experiments, fracture assessment from low dose CT was consistent with the reference standard dose CT results across all participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our CT-based automated method for vertebral fracture assessment is accurate, and it offers a feasible alternative to manual expert reading, especially for large population-based studies, where automation is important for high efficiency. Generalizability of the method to low dose CT imaging further extends the scope of application of the method, particularly since the usage of low dose CT imaging in large population-based studies has increased to reduce cumulative radiation exposure.",other,Not specified

Creating an accurate image-based processing system for screening patients can help in the early diagnosis of this disease. We provided a dataset containing1078 confirmed negative and 469 positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis instances. An effective method using an improved and generalized convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed for classifying TB bacteria in microscopic images. In the preprocessing phase, the insignificant parts of microscopic images are excluded with an efficient algorithm based on the square rough entropy (SRE) thresholding. Top 10 policies of data augmentation were selected with the proposed model based on the Greedy AutoAugment algorithm to resolve the overfitting problem. In order to improve the generalization of CNN, mixed pooling was used instead of baseline one. The results showed that employing generalized pooling, batch normalization, Dropout, and PReLU have improved the classification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis images. The output of classifiers such as Naïve Bayes-LBP, KNN-LBP, GBT-LBP, Naïve Bayes-HOG, KNN-HOG, SVM-HOG, GBT-HOG indicated that proposed CNN has the best results with an accuracy of 93.4%.

Apart from their scientific merit, these models are often used to inform political decisions and interventional measures during an ongoing outbreak. However, reliably inferring the epidemical dynamics by connecting complex models to real data is still hard and requires either laborious manual parameter fitting or expensive optimization methods which have to be repeated from scratch for every application of a given model. In this work, we address this problem with a novel combination of epidemiological modeling with specialized neural networks. Our approach entails two computational phases: In an initial training phase, a mathematical model describing the epidemic is used as a coach for a neural network, which acquires global knowledge about the full range of possible disease dynamics. In the subsequent inference phase, the trained neural network processes the observed data of an actual outbreak and infers the parameters of the model in order to realistically reproduce the observed dynamics and reliably predict future progression. With its flexible framework, our simulation-based approach is applicable to a variety of epidemiological models. Moreover, since our method is fully Bayesian, it is designed to incorporate all available prior knowledge about plausible parameter values and returns complete joint posterior distributions over these parameters. Application of our method to the early Covid-19 outbreak phase in Germany demonstrates that we are able to obtain reliable probabilistic estimates for important disease characteristics, such as generation time, fraction of undetected infections, likelihood of transmission before symptom onset, and reporting delays using a very moderate amount of real-world observations.",other,Not specified

In particular, for its noninvasive and ubiquitous character by nature, CA-based applications in healthcare have increasingly attracted attention in recent years. During the tough time of the global crisis caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), scientists and engineers in data science have collaborated to think of novel ways in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, tracking, and management of this global pandemic. On the one hand, we have witnessed the power of 5G, Internet of Things, big data, computer vision, and artificial intelligence in applications of epidemiology modeling, drug and/or vaccine finding and designing, fast CT screening, and quarantine management. On the other hand, relevant studies in exploring the capacity of CA are extremely lacking and underestimated. To this end, we propose a novel multitask speech corpus for COVID-19 research usage. We collected 51 confirmed COVID-19 patients' in-the-wild speech data in Wuhan city, China. We define three main tasks in this corpus, i.e., three-category classification tasks for evaluating the physical and/or mental status of patients, i.e., sleep quality, fatigue, and anxiety. The benchmarks are given by using both classic machine learning methods and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

However, the broader applicability of retinal photograph-based deep learning for predicting other systemic biomarkers and the generalisability of this approach to various populations remains unexplored.
METHODS: With use of 236 257 retinal photographs from seven diverse Asian and European cohorts (two health screening centres in South Korea, the Beijing Eye Study, three cohorts in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study, and the UK Biobank), we evaluated the capacities of 47 deep-learning algorithms to predict 47 systemic biomarkers as outcome variables, including demographic factors (age and sex); body composition measurements; blood pressure; haematological parameters; lipid profiles; biochemical measures; biomarkers related to liver function, thyroid function, kidney function, and inflammation; and diabetes. The standard neural network architecture of VGG16 was adopted for model development.
FINDINGS: In addition to previously reported systemic biomarkers, we showed quantification of body composition indices (muscle mass, height, and bodyweight) and creatinine from retinal photographs. Body muscle mass could be predicted with an R2 of 0·52 (95% CI 0·51-0·53) in the internal test set, and of 0·33 (0·30-0·35) in one external test set with muscle mass measurement available. The R2 value for the prediction of height was 0·42 (0·40-0·43), of bodyweight was 0·36 (0·34-0·37), and of creatinine was 0·38 (0·37-0·40) in the internal test set. However, the performances were poorer in external test sets (with the lowest performance in the European cohort), with R2 values ranging between 0·08 and 0·28 for height, 0·04 and 0·19 for bodyweight, and 0·01 and 0·26 for creatinine. Of the 47 systemic biomarkers, 37 could not be predicted well from retinal photographs via deep learning (R2≤0·14 across all external test sets).
INTERPRETATION: Our work provides new insights into the potential use of retinal photographs to predict systemic biomarkers, including body composition indices and serum creatinine, using deep learning in populations with a similar ethnic background. Further evaluations are warranted to validate these findings and evaluate the clinical utility of these algorithms.

These techniques were used here to develop an algorithm aimed to track and compute animal motion in real time. This algorithm was used in experimental trials in order to assess African swine fever (ASF) infection course in Eurasian wild boar. Overall, the outcomes showed negative correlation between motion reduction and fever caused by ASF infection. In addition, infected animals computed significant lower movements compared to uninfected animals. The obtained results suggest that a motion monitoring system based on artificial vision may be used in indoors to trigger suspicions of fever. It would help farmers and animal health services to detect early clinical signs compatible with infectious diseases.

OBJECTIVES: Here we discuss the promise, challenges, and probable data sources needed to apply AI in the fields of exposure science and environmental health. In particular, we focus on the use of deep convolutional neural networks to estimate environmental exposures using images and other complementary data sources such as cell phone mobility and social media information.
DISCUSSION: Characterizing the health impacts of multiple spatially-correlated exposures remains a challenge in environmental epidemiology. A shift toward integrated measures that simultaneously capture multiple aspects of the urban built environment could improve efficiency and provide important insights into how our collective environments influence population health. The widespread adoption of AI in exposure science is on the frontier. This will likely result in new ways of understanding environmental impacts on health and may allow for analyses to be efficiently scaled for broad coverage. Image-based convolutional neural networks may also offer a cost-effective means of estimating local environmental exposures in low and middle-income countries where monitoring and surveillance infrastructure is limited. However, suitable databases must first be assembled to train and evaluate these models and these novel approaches should be complemented with traditional exposure metrics.
CONCLUSIONS: The promise of deep learning in environmental health is great and will complement existing measurements for data-rich settings and could enhance the resolution and accuracy of estimates in data poor scenarios. Interdisciplinary partnerships will be needed to fully realize this potential.",other,Not specified

The AJCC-TNM system cannot accurately determine prognosis, our study aimed to identify prognostic factors for MHCC and to develop a prognostic model to quantify the risk and survival probability of patients.
METHODS: Eligible patients with HCC were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and then prognostic models were built using Cox regression, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The model's performance was evaluated using C-index, receiver operating characteristic curve, Brier score and decision curve analysis, respectively, and the best model was interpreted using SHapley additive explanations (SHAP) interpretability technique.
RESULTS: A total of eight variables were included in the follow-up study, our analysis identified that the gradient boosted machine (GBM) model was the best prognostic model for advanced MHCC. In particular, the GBM model in the training cohort had a C-index of 0.73, a Brier score of 0.124, with area under the curve (AUC) values above 0.78 at the first, third, and fifth year.

In this study, we aimed to develop a novel deep-learning-based biological ageing marker (referred to as RetiPhenoAge hereafter) using retinal images and PhenoAge, a composite biomarker of phenotypic age.
METHODS: We used retinal photographs from the UK Biobank dataset to train a deep-learning algorithm to predict the composite score of PhenoAge. We used a deep convolutional neural network architecture with multiple layers to develop our deep-learning-based biological ageing marker, as RetiPhenoAge, with the aim of identifying patterns and features in the retina associated with variations of blood biomarkers related to renal, immune, liver functions, inflammation, and energy metabolism, and chronological age. We determined the performance of this biological ageing marker for the prediction of morbidity (cardiovascular disease and cancer events) and mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) in three independent cohorts (UK Biobank, the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases [SEED], and the Age-Related Eye Disease Study [AREDS] from the USA). We also compared the performance of RetiPhenoAge with two other known ageing biomarkers (hand grip strength and adjusted leukocyte telomere length) and one lifestyle factor (physical activity) for risk stratification of mortality and morbidity. We explored the underlying biology of RetiPhenoAge by assessing its associations with different systemic characteristics (eg, diabetes or hypertension) and blood metabolite levels. We also did a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with RetiPhenoAge, followed by expression quantitative trait loci mapping, a gene-based analysis, and a gene-set analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs for the associations between RetiPhenoAge and the different morbidity and mortality outcomes.
FINDINGS: Retinal photographs for 34 061 UK Biobank participants were used to train the model, and data for 9429 participants from the SEED cohort and for 3986 participants from the AREDS cohort were included in the study. RetiPhenoAge was associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1·92 [95% CI 1·42-2·61]), cardiovascular disease mortality (1·97 [1·02-3·82]), cancer mortality (2·07 [1·29-3·33]), and cardiovascular disease events (1·70 [1·17-2·47]), independent of PhenoAge and other possible confounders. Similar findings were found in the two independent cohorts (HR 1·67 [1·21-2·31] for cardiovascular disease mortality in SEED and 2·07 [1·10-3·92] in AREDS). RetiPhenoAge had stronger associations with mortality and morbidity than did hand grip strength, telomere length, and physical activity. We identified two genetic variants that were significantly associated with RetiPhenoAge (single nucleotide polymorphisms rs3791224 and rs8001273), and were linked to expression quantitative trait locis in various tissues, including the heart, kidneys, and the brain.
INTERPRETATION: Our new deep-learning-derived biological ageing marker is a robust predictor of mortality and morbidity outcomes and could be used as a novel non-invasive method to measure ageing.

Advances in MD simulation analysis combined with deep learning-based approaches have led to the understanding of specific structural changes observed in MD trajectories, including those induced by mutations. In this study, we model the trajectories resulting from MD simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2, specifically the receptor-binding domain (RBD), as interresidue distance maps, and use deep convolutional neural networks to predict the functional impact of point mutations, related to the virus's infectivity and immunogenicity. Our model was successful in predicting mutant types that increase the affinity of the S protein for human receptors and reduce its immunogenicity, both based on MD trajectories (precision = 0.718; recall = 0.800; [Formula: see text] = 0.757; MCC = 0.488; AUC = 0.800) and their centroids. In an additional analysis, we also obtained a strong positive Pearson's correlation coefficient equal to 0.776, indicating a significant relationship between the average sigmoid probability for the MD trajectories and binding free energy (BFE) changes. Furthermore, we obtained a coefficient of determination of 0.602. Our 2D-RMSD analysis also corroborated predictions for more infectious and immune-evading mutants and revealed fluctuating regions within the receptor-binding motif (RBM), especially in the [Formula: see text] loop. This region presented a significant standard deviation for mutations that enable SARS-CoV-2 to evade the immune response, with RMSD values of 5Å in the simulation. This methodology offers an efficient alternative to identify potential strains of SARS-CoV-2, which may be potentially linked to more infectious and immune-evading mutations. Using clustering and deep learning techniques, our approach leverages information from the ensemble of MD trajectories to recognize a broad spectrum of multiple conformational patterns characteristic of mutant types. This represents a strategic advantage in identifying emerging variants, bypassing the need for long MD simulations. Furthermore, the present work tends to contribute substantially to the field of computational biology and virology, particularly to accelerate the design and optimization of new therapeutic agents and vaccines, offering a proactive stance against the constantly evolving threat of COVID-19 and potential future pandemics.",other,Not specified

STUDY DESIGN: The study involved pediatric glioma patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry (2000-2018) and Tangdu Hospital in China (2010-2018) within specific time frames. For training, we selected two neural network-based algorithms (DeepSurv, neural multi-task logistic regression [N-MTLR]) and one ensemble learning-based algorithm (random survival forest [RSF]). Additionally, a multivariable Cox proportional hazard (CoxPH) model was developed for comparison purposes.

Super-parameters were fine-tuned through 1000 repeated random searches and 5-fold cross-validation on the training cohort. Model performance was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), Brier score, and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). Furthermore, the accuracy of predicting survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and the area under the ROC curves (AUC). The generalization ability of the model was assessed using the C-index of the Tangdu Hospital data, ROC curves for 1, 3, and 5 years, and AUC values. Lastly, decision curve analysis (DCA) curves for 1, 3, and 5-year time frames are provided to assess the net benefits across different models.
RESULTS: A total of 9532 patients with pediatric glioma were included in this study, comprising 9274 patients from the SEER database and 258 patients from Tangdu Hospital in China. The average age at diagnosis was 9.4 ± 6.2 years, and the average survival time was 96 ± 66 months. Through comprehensive performance comparison, the DeepSurv model demonstrated the highest effectiveness, with a C-index of 0.881 on the training cohort. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent accuracy in predicting the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates (AUC: 0.903-0.939). Notably, the DeepSurv model also achieved remarkable performance and accuracy on the Chinese dataset (C-index: 0.782, AUC: 0.761-0.852). Comprehensive analysis of DeepSurv, N-MTLR, and RSF revealed that tumor stage, radiotherapy, histological type, tumor size, chemotherapy, age, and surgical method are all significant factors influencing the prognosis of pediatric glioma. Finally, an online version of the pediatric glioma survival predictor based on the DeepSurv model has been established and can be accessed through https://pediatricglioma-tangdu.streamlit.app.
CONCLUSIONS: The DeepSurv model exhibits exceptional efficacy in predicting the survival of pediatric glioma patients, demonstrating strong performance in discrimination, calibration, stability, and generalization. By utilizing the online version of the pediatric glioma survival predictor, which is based on the DeepSurv model, clinicians can accurately predict patient survival and offer personalized treatment options.",other,Not specified

This heterogeneity often reflects variations in the chromatin structure, influenced by factors such as viral infections and cancer, which dramatically reshape the cellular landscape. To address the challenge of identifying distinct cell states, we developed artificial intelligence of the nucleus (AINU), a deep learning method that can identify specific nuclear signatures at the nanoscale resolution. AINU can distinguish different cell states based on the spatial arrangement of core histone H3, RNA polymerase II or DNA from super-resolution microscopy images. With only a small number of images as the training data, AINU correctly identifies human somatic cells, human-induced pluripotent stem cells, very early stage infected cells transduced with DNA herpes simplex virus type 1 and even cancer cells after appropriate retraining. Finally, using AI interpretability methods, we find that the RNA polymerase II localizations in the nucleoli aid in distinguishing human-induced pluripotent stem cells from their somatic cells. Overall, AINU coupled with super-resolution microscopy of nuclear structures provides a robust tool for the precise detection of cellular heterogeneity, with considerable potential for advancing diagnostics and therapies in regenerative medicine, virology and cancer biology.",transformer/generative,Not specified

However, an extensible framework for comprehensive exploratory analysis that accounts for data heterogeneity is missing. Here we introduce ehrapy, a modular open-source Python framework designed for exploratory analysis of heterogeneous epidemiology and EHR data. ehrapy incorporates a series of analytical steps, from data extraction and quality control to the generation of low-dimensional representations. Complemented by rich statistical modules, ehrapy facilitates associating patients with disease states, differential comparison between patient clusters, survival analysis, trajectory inference, causal inference and more. Leveraging ontologies, ehrapy further enables data sharing and training EHR deep learning models, paving the way for foundational models in biomedical research. We demonstrate ehrapy's features in six distinct examples. We applied ehrapy to stratify patients affected by unspecified pneumonia into finer-grained phenotypes. Furthermore, we reveal biomarkers for significant differences in survival among these groups. Additionally, we quantify medication-class effects of pneumonia medications on length of stay. We further leveraged ehrapy to analyze cardiovascular risks across different data modalities. We reconstructed disease state trajectories in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on imaging data. Finally, we conducted a case study to demonstrate how ehrapy can detect and mitigate biases in EHR data. ehrapy, thus, provides a framework that we envision will standardize analysis pipelines on EHR data and serve as a cornerstone for the community.",other,Not specified

Integrating machine learning techniques into obesity research offers great promise as an interdisciplinary field, particularly in the screening, diagnosis, and analysis of obesity. Nevertheless, the publications on using machine learning methods in obesity research have not been systematically evaluated. Hence, this study aimed to quantitatively examine, visualize, and analyze the publications concerning the use of machine learning methods in obesity research by means of bibliometrics.
METHODS: The Web of Science core collection was the primary database source for this study, which collected publications on obesity research using machine learning methods over the last 20 years from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2023. Only articles and reviews that fit the criteria were selected for bibliometric analysis, and in terms of language, only English was accepted. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Excel were the primary software utilized.
RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2023, the number of publications on obesity research using machine learning methods increased exponentially. Eventually, 3286 publications that met the eligibility criteria were searched. According to the collaborative network analysis, the United States has the greatest volume of publications, indicating a significant influence on this research. coauthor's analysis showed the authoritative one in this field is Leo Breiman.

This retrospective study compared three simulated AI-integrated screening scenarios with standard double reading with arbitration in a sample of 249 402 mammograms from a representative screening population. A commercial AI system replaced the first reader (scenario 1: integrated AI<sub>first</sub>), the second reader (scenario 2: integrated AI<sub>second</sub>), or both readers for triaging of low- and high-risk cases (scenario 3: integrated AI<sub>triage</sub>). AI threshold values were chosen based partly on previous validation and setting the screen-read volume reduction at approximately 50% across scenarios. Detection accuracy measures were calculated. Compared with standard double reading, integrated AI<sub>first</sub> showed no evidence of a difference in accuracy metrics except for a higher arbitration rate (+0.99%, P &lt; .001). Integrated AI<sub>second</sub> had lower sensitivity (-1.58%, P &lt; .001), negative predictive value (NPV) (-0.01%, P &lt; .001), and recall rate (-0.06%, P = .04) but a higher positive predictive value (PPV) (+0.03%, P &lt; .001) and arbitration rate (+1.22%, P &lt; .001).

Online ahead of print.,Ganglberger W,Sleep,2024,2024/08/31,,,10.1093/sleep/zsae202,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to 1) improve sleep staging accuracy through transfer learning, to achieve or exceede human inter-expert agreement; 2) introduce a scorability model to assess the quality and trustworthiness of automated sleep staging.
METHODS: A deep neural network (base model) was trained on a large multi-site polysomnography (PSG) dataset from the United States. Transfer learning was used to calibrate the model to a reduced montage and limited samples from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) dataset. Model performance was compared to inter-expert reliability among three human experts. A scorability assessment was developed to predict the agreement between the model and human experts.
RESULTS: Initial sleep staging by the base model showed lower agreement with experts (κ=0.55) compared to inter-expert agreement (κ=0.62). Calibration with 324 randomly sampled training cases matched expert agreement levels. Further targeted sampling improved performance, with models exceeding inter-expert agreement (κ=0.70). The scorability assessment, combining biosignal quality and model confidence features, predicted model-expert agreement moderately well (R²=0.42). Recordings with higher scorability scores demonstrated greater model-expert agreement than inter-expert agreement. Even with lower scorability scores, model performance was comparable to inter-expert agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: Fine-tuning a pre-trained neural network through targeted transfer learning significantly enhances sleep staging performance for an atypical montage, achieving and surpassing human expert agreement levels. The introduction of a scorability assessment provides a robust measure of reliability, ensuring quality control and enhancing the practical application of the system before deployment. This approach marks an important advancement in automated sleep analysis, demonstrating the potential for AI to exceed human performance in clinical settings.",other,Not specified

The purpose of these assays is twofold: to categorize affected individuals into groups for initial treatments, and to provide definitive dose estimates for continued care and epidemiology. However, existing high-throughput cytogenetic biodosimetry assays take about 3 days to yield results, which delays critical interventions. We have developed a multiwell-based variant of the chemical-induced G0-phase Premature Chromosome Condensation Assay that delivers same-day results. Our findings revealed that using a concentration of phosphatase inhibitor lower than recommended significantly increases the yield of cells with highly condensed chromosomes. These chromosomes exhibited increased fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner, enabling to quantify radiation damage using a custom Deep Learning algorithm. This algorithm demonstrated reasonable performance in categorizing doses into distinct treatment groups (84% and 80% accuracy for three and four iso-treatment dose bins, respectively) and showed reliability in determining the actual doses received (correlation coefficient of 0.879). This method is amendable to full automation and has the potential to address the need for same-day, high-throughput cytogenetic test for both dose categorization and dose reconstruction in large-scale radiation emergencies.",other,Not specified

However, the performance of ViTs in referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection is relatively underexplored. In this study, using retinal photographs, we evaluated the comparative performances of ViTs and CNNs on detection of referable DR.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 48 269 retinal images from the open-source Kaggle DR detection dataset, the Messidor-1 dataset and the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study were included.
METHODS: Using 41 614 retinal photographs from the Kaggle dataset, we developed 5 CNN (Visual Geometry Group 19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetV2S) and 4 ViTs models (VAN_small, CrossViT_small, ViT_small, and Hierarchical Vision transformer using Shifted Windows [SWIN]_tiny) for the detection of referable DR. We defined the presence of referable DR as eyes with moderate or worse DR. The comparative performance of all 9 models was evaluated in the Kaggle internal test dataset (with 1045 study eyes), and in 2 external test sets, the SEED study (5455 study eyes) and the Messidor-1 (1200 study eyes).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under operating characteristics curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity.
RESULTS: Among all models, the SWIN transformer displayed the highest AUC of 95.7% on the internal test set, significantly outperforming the CNN models (all P &lt; 0.001). The same observation was confirmed in the external test sets, with the SWIN transformer achieving AUC of 97.3% in SEED and 96.3% in Messidor-1. When specificity level was fixed at 80% for the internal test, the SWIN transformer achieved the highest sensitivity of 94.4%, significantly better than all the CNN models (sensitivity levels ranging between 76.3% and 83.8%; all P &lt; 0.001). This trend was also consistently observed in both external test sets.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that ViTs provide superior performance over CNNs in detecting referable DR from retinal photographs. These results point to the potential of utilizing ViT models to improve and optimize retinal photo-based deep learning for referable DR detection.

These models, although able to draw complex relations between input and target, are also inclined to learn noisy deviations from the pool of data used during their development. In order to assess their performance on unseen data (their capacity to generalize), it is common to split the available data randomly into development (train/validation) and test sets. This procedure, although standard, has been shown to produce dubious assessments of generalization due to the existing similarity between samples in the databases used. In this work, we present SpanSeq, a database partition method for machine learning that can scale to most biological sequences (genes, proteins and genomes) in order to avoid data leakage between sets. We also explore the effect of not restraining similarity between sets by reproducing the development of two state-of-the-art models on bioinformatics, not only confirming the consequences of randomly splitting databases on the model assessment, but expanding those repercussions to the model development.

This article provides a brief review spanning epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, and risk factors associated with PE, mainly discussing the emerging role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deep learning (DL) technology in predicting PE, to advance the understanding of PE and foster the clinical application of early prediction methods.
METHODS: Our narrative review comprehensively examines the PE epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, risk factors and predictive approaches, including traditional models and AI deep learning technology.
RESULTS: Preeclampsia involves a wide range of biological and biochemical risk factors, among which poor uterine artery remodeling, excessive immune response, endothelial dysfunction, and imbalanced angiogenesis play important roles. Traditional PE prediction models exhibit significant limitations in sensitivity and specificity, particularly in predicting late-onset PE, with detection rates ranging from only 30% to 50%. AI models have exhibited a notable level of predictive accuracy and value across various populations and datasets, achieving detection rates of approximately 70%. Particularly, they have shown superior predictive capabilities for late-onset PE, thereby presenting novel opportunities for early screening and management of the condition.
CONCLUSION: AI DL technology holds promise in revolutionizing the prediction and management of PE.

After the age of 50 years, the risk of hip fracture doubles in every 10 years. x-Ray based DXA is currently clinically used to diagnose osteoporosis and predict fracture risk. However, it provides only 2-D representation of bone and is associated with other technical limitations. Thus, alternative methods are needed.
PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate an ultra-low dose (ULD) hip CT-based automated method for assessment of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at proximal femoral subregions.
METHODS: An automated method was developed to segment the proximal femur in ULD hip CT images and delineate femoral subregions. The computational pipeline consists of deep learning (DL)-based computation of femur likelihood map followed by shape model-based femur segmentation and finite element analysis-based warping of a reference subregion labeling onto individual femur shapes. Finally, vBMD is computed over each subregion in the target image using a calibration phantom scan. A total of 100 participants (50 females) were recruited from the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study, and ULD hip CT imaging, equivalent to 18 days of background radiation received by U.S. residents, was performed on each participant. Additional hip CT imaging using a clinical protocol was performed on 12 participants and repeat ULD hip CT was acquired on another five participants. ULD CT images from 80 participants were used to train the DL network; ULD CT images of the remaining 20 participants as well as clinical and repeat ULD CT images were used to evaluate the accuracy, generalizability, and reproducibility of segmentation of femoral subregions. Finally, clinical CT and repeat ULD CT images were used to evaluate accuracy and reproducibility of ULD CT-based automated measurements of femoral vBMD.
RESULTS: Dice scores of accuracy (n = 20), reproducibility (n = 5), and generalizability (n = 12) of ULD CT-based automated subregion segmentation were 0.990, 0.982, and 0.977, respectively, for the femoral head and 0.941, 0.970, and 0.960, respectively, for the femoral neck. ULD CT-based regional vBMD showed Pearson and concordance correlation coefficients of 0.994 and 0.977, respectively, and a root-mean-square coefficient of variation (RMSCV) (%) of 1.39% with the clinical CT-derived reference measure. After 3-digit approximation, each of Pearson and concordance correlation coefficients as well as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between baseline and repeat scans were 0.996 with RMSCV of 0.72%. Results of ULD CT-based bone analysis on 100 participants (age (mean ± SD) 73.6 ± 6.6 years) show that males have significantly greater (p < 0.01) vBMD at the femoral head and trochanteric regions than females, while females have moderately greater vBMD (p = 0.05) at the medial half of the femoral neck than males.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning, combined with shape model and finite element analysis, offers an accurate, reproducible, and generalizable algorithm for automated segmentation of the proximal femur and anatomic femoral subregions using ULD hip CT images. ULD CT-based regional measures of femoral vBMD are accurate and reproducible and demonstrate regional differences between males and females.",other,Not specified

AIM: To investigate the prognosis of GMA and develop predictive model.
METHODS: From the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we collected clinical information on patients with GMA. After random sampling, the patients were divided into the discovery (70% of the total, for model training), validation (20%, for model evaluation), and completely blind test cohorts (10%, for further model evaluation). The main assessment metric was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). All collected clinical features were used for Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to determine factors influencing GMA's prognosis.
RESULTS: This model had an AUC of 0.7433 [95% confidence intervals (95%CI): 0.7424-0.7442] in the discovery cohort, 0.7244 (GMA: 0.7234-0.7254) in the validation cohort, and 0.7388 (95%CI: 0.7378-0.7398) in the test cohort.

Hence, we collected information on patients with Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the United States from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and EndResults (SEER) database. We used this information to establish a deep learning with a multilayer neural network (the NMTLR model) for predicting the survival rate of patients with Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma. HCC patients pathologically diagnosed between January 2011 and December 2015 in the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database of the National Cancer Institute of the United States were selected as study subjects. We utilized two deep learning-based algorithms (DeepSurv and Neural Multi-Task Logistic Regression [NMTLR]) and a machine learning-based algorithm (Random Survival Forest [RSF]) for model training. A multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) model was also constructed for comparison. The dataset was randomly divided into a training set and a test set in a 7:3 ratio. The training dataset underwent hyperparameter tuning through 1000 iterations of random search and fivefold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), Brier score, and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). The accuracy of predicting 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The primary outcomes were the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival rates. Models were developed using DeepSurv, NMTLR, RSF, and Cox Proportional Hazards regression. Model differentiation was evaluated using the C-index, calibration with concordance plots, and risk stratification capability with the log-rank test. The study included 2197 HCC patients, randomly divided into a training cohort (70%, n = 1537) and a testing cohort (30%, n = 660). Clinical characteristics between the two cohorts showed no significant statistical difference (p > 0.05). The deep learning models outperformed both RSF and CoxPH models, with C-indices of 0.735 (NMTLR) and 0.731 (DeepSurv) in the test dataset. The NMTLR model demonstrated enhanced accuracy and well-calibrated survival estimates, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.824 for 1-year survival predictions, 0.813 for 3-year, and 0.803 for 5-year survival rates. This model's superior calibration and discriminative ability enhance its utility for clinical prognostication in Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma. We deployed the NMTLR model as a web application for clinical practice. The NMTLR model have potential advantages over traditional linear models in prognostic assessment and treatment recommendations. This novel analytical approach may provide reliable information on individual survival and treatment recommendations for patients with primary liver cancer.",other,Not specified

This study assessed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) combined with machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to identify toxigenic strains (producing TcdA, TcdB with or without CDT) and Hv strains. In total, 201 CD strains were analysed, comprising 151 toxigenic (24 ToxA+B+CDT+, 22 ToxA+B+CDT+ Hv+ and 105 ToxA+B+CDT-) and 50 non-toxigenic (ToxA-B-) strains. The DL-based classifier exhibited a 0.95 negative predictive value for excluding ToxA-B- strains, showcasing accuracy in identifying this strain category. Sensitivity in correctly identifying ToxA+B+CDT- strains ranged from 0.68 to 0.91. Additionally, all classifiers consistently demonstrated high specificity (&gt;0.96) in detecting ToxA+B+CDT+ strains.

Yet, these models face limitations due to overfitting and the potential overestimation of effect sizes in correlated variants. To surmount these obstacles, we devised the Stacked Neural Network Polygenic Risk Score (SNPRS). This novel approach synthesises outputs from multiple neural network models, each calibrated using genetic variants chosen based on diverse p-value thresholds. By doing so, SNPRS captures a broader array of genetic variants, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of the combined effects of these variants. We assessed the efficacy of SNPRS using the UK Biobank data, focusing on the genetic risks associated with breast and prostate cancers, as well as quantitative traits like height and BMI. We also extended our analysis to the Korea Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) dataset. Impressively, our results indicate that SNPRS surpasses traditional PRS models and an isolated deep neural network in terms of accuracy, highlighting its promise in refining the efficacy and relevance of PRS in genetic studies.",other,Not specified

Regarding viral infection, many therapeutics have been investigated to alleviate the epidemiology such as vaccines and receptor decoys. However, the continuous mutating coronavirus, especially the variants of Delta and Omicron, are tended to invalidate the therapeutic biological product. Thus, it is necessary to develop molecular entities as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Coronavirus replication is controlled by the viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme, which is required for the virus's life cycle. In the cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 3CLpro has been shown to be a promising therapeutic development target. Here we proposed an attention-based deep learning framework for molecular graphs and sequences, training from the BindingDB 3CLpro dataset (114,555 compounds). After construction of such model, we conducted large-scale screening the in vivo/vitro dataset (276,003 compounds) from Zinc Database and visualize the candidate compounds with attention score. geometric-based affinity prediction was employed for validation.

METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we used the characteristics of patients diagnosed with CC between 2010 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The population was randomized into a training set (n = 10 596, 70%) and a test set (n = 4536, 30%). Brier scores, area under the (AUC) receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration curves were used to compare the performance of the three most popular deep learning models, namely, artificial neural networks (ANN), deep neural networks (DNN), and long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks with Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model.
RESULTS: In the independent test set, the Brier values of ANN, DNN, LSTM and CPH were 0.155, 0.149, 0.148, and 0.170, respectively. The AUC values were 0.906 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.897-0.916), 0.908 (95% CI 0.899-0.918), 0.910 (95% CI 0.901-0.919), and 0.793 (95% CI 0.769-0.816), respectively.

The goal of this study was to create and assess models for GIST patients' survival patients using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database based on the three different deep learning models. Four thousand five hundred thirty-eight patients were enrolled in this study and divided into training and test cohorts with a 7:3 ratio; the training cohort was used to develop three different models, including Cox regression, RSF, and DeepSurv model. Test cohort was used to evaluate model performance using c-index, Brier scores, calibration, and the area under the curve (AUC). The net benefits at risk score stratification of GIST patients based on the optimal model was compared with the traditional AJCC staging system using decision curve analysis (DCA). The clinical usefulness of risk score stratification compared to AJCC tumor staging was further assessed using the Net Reclassification Index (NRI) and Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI). The DeepSurv model predicted cancer-specific survival (CSS) in GIST patients showed a higher c-index (0.825), lower Brier scores (0.142), and greater AUC of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (1-year ROC:0.898; 3-year:0.853, and 5-year ROC: 0.856).

Multiple prediction models based on machine learning have been developed to assess the likelihood of developing DM.
METHODS: Clinicopathological features of patients with CRC were obtained from the National Cancer Center (NCC, China) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The algorithms used to create the prediction models included random forest (RF), logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting, deep neural networks, and the K-Nearest Neighbor machine. The prediction models' performances were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
RESULTS: In total, 200,958 patients, 3241 from NCC and 197,717 CRC from SEER were identified, of whom 21,736 (10.8%) developed DM. The machine-learning-based prediction models for DM were constructed with 12 features remaining after iterative filtering. The RF model performed the best, with areas under the ROC curve of 0.843, 0.793, and 0.806, respectively, on the training, test, and external validation sets. For the risk stratification analysis, the patients were separated into high-, middle-, and low-risk groups according to their risk scores. Patients in the high-risk group had the highest incidence of DM and the worst prognosis. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy could significantly improve the prognosis of the high-risk and middle-risk groups, whereas the low-risk group only benefited from surgery and chemotherapy.

Early detection of congenital anomalies facilitates life-saving treatments and stops the progression of disabilities. Congenital anomalies can be diagnosed prenatally through morphology scans. A correct interpretation of the morphology scan allows a detailed discussion with the parents regarding the prognosis. The central feature of this project is the development of a specialised intelligent system that uses two-dimensional ultrasound movies obtained during the standard second trimester morphology scan to identify congenital anomalies in fetuses.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The project focuses on three pillars: committee of deep learning and statistical learning algorithms, statistical analysis, and operational research through learning curves. The cross-sectional study is divided into a training phase where the system learns to detect congenital anomalies using fetal morphology ultrasound scan, and then it is tested on previously unseen scans. In the training phase, the intelligent system will learn to answer the following specific objectives: (a) the system will learn to guide the sonographer's probe for better acquisition; (b) the fetal planes will be automatically detected, measured and stored and (c) unusual findings will be signalled. During the testing phase, the system will automatically perform the above tasks on previously unseen videos.Pregnant patients in their second trimester admitted for their routine scan will be consecutively included in a 32-month study (4 May 2022-31 December 2024). The number of patients is 4000, enrolled by 10 doctors/sonographers. We will develop an intelligent system that uses multiple artificial intelligence algorithms that interact between themselves, in bulk or individual. For each anatomical part, there will be an algorithm in charge of detecting it, followed by another algorithm that will detect whether anomalies are present or not. The sonographers will validate the findings at each intermediate step.

To assess dataset skewness and detect feature importance, we applied Pearson's second coefficient test of skewness and the Ordinary Least Squares method, respectively. Using two sampling strategies, holdout and five-fold cross-validation, we developed five machine learning (ML) models alongside a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) for the multiclass classification and regression prediction of glioblastoma patient survival. After balancing the classification and regression datasets, we obtained 46,340 and 28,573 samples, respectively. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were then used to explain the decision-making process of the best model. In both classification and regression tasks, as well as across holdout and cross-validation sampling strategies, the DNN consistently outperformed the ML models. Notably, the accuracy were 90.25% and 90.22% for holdout and five-fold cross-validation, respectively, while the corresponding R2 values were 0.6565 and 0.6622. SHAP analysis revealed the importance of age at diagnosis as the most influential feature in the DNN's survival predictions.

Likelihood-based methods fit models to phylogenies to draw inferences about the phylodynamics and history of viral transmission. However, these methods are often computationally expensive, which limits the complexity and realism of phylodynamic models and makes them ill-suited for informing policy decisions in real-time during rapidly developing outbreaks. Likelihood-free methods using deep learning are pushing the boundaries of inference beyond these constraints. In this paper, we extend, compare, and contrast a recently developed deep learning method for likelihood-free inference from trees. We trained multiple deep neural networks using phylogenies from simulated outbreaks that spread among 5 locations and found they achieve close to the same levels of accuracy as Bayesian inference under the true simulation model. We compared robustness to model misspecification of a trained neural network to that of a Bayesian method. We found that both models had comparable performance, converging on similar biases. We also implemented a method of uncertainty quantification called conformalized quantile regression that we demonstrate has similar patterns of sensitivity to model misspecification as Bayesian highest posterior density (HPD) and greatly overlap with HPDs, but have lower precision (more conservative). Finally, we trained and tested a neural network against phylogeographic data from a recent study of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in Europe and obtained similar estimates of region-specific epidemiological parameters and the location of the common ancestor in Europe. Along with being as accurate and robust as likelihood-based methods, our trained neural networks are on average over 3 orders of magnitude faster after training. Our results support the notion that neural networks can be trained with simulated data to accurately mimic the good and bad statistical properties of the likelihood functions of generative phylogenetic models.",other,Not specified

There is a lack of a related molecular classification prediction system based on pathological images for precision medicine.
METHODS: Integration of epidemiology, genomics, experiments, and deep learning to clarify the clinical value and molecular characteristics, and develop a novel OSCC molecular classification prediction system.
RESULTS: Large-scale epidemiology data (n = 118,817) demonstrated OSCC differentiation was a significant prognosis indicator (p < 0.001), and well-differentiated OSCC was more chemo-resistant than poorly differentiated OSCC. These results were confirmed in the TCGA database and in vitro. Furthermore, we found chemo-resistant related pathways and cell cycle-related pathways were up-regulated in well- and poorly differentiated OSCC, respectively. Based on the characteristics of OSCC differentiation, a molecular grade of OSCC was obtained and combined with pathological images to establish a novel prediction system through deep learning, named ShuffleNetV2-based Molecular Grade of OSCC (SMGO). Importantly, our independent multi-center cohort of OSCC (n = 340) confirmed the high accuracy of SMGO.
CONCLUSIONS: OSCC differentiation was a significant indicator of prognosis and chemotherapy selection. Importantly, SMGO could be an indispensable reference for OSCC differentiation and assist the decision-making of chemotherapy.",other,Not specified

There is a need to further characterize hepatic steatosis in lean patients, as its epidemiology may differ from that in overweight patients. A deep learning method determined the spleen-hepatic attenuation difference (SHAD) in Hounsfield Units (HU) on abdominal CT scans as a quantitative measure of hepatic steatosis. The patient cohort was stratified by BMI with a threshold of 25 kg/m2 and hepatic steatosis with threshold SHAD ≥  - 1 HU or liver mean attenuation ≤ 40 HU. Patient characteristics, diagnoses, and laboratory results representing metabolism and liver function were investigated. A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) was performed for the statistical interaction between SHAD and the binary characteristic LEAN. The cohort contained 8914 patients-lean patients with (N = 278, 3.1%) and without (N = 1867, 20.9%) steatosis, and overweight patients with (N = 1863, 20.9%) and without (N = 4906, 55.0%) steatosis.

Thus, the ability of classifiers to make reliable decisions is of paramount importance. Deep neural networks (DNNs) represent the state-of-the-art models to address real-world classification. Although the strength of activation in DNNs is often correlated with the network's confidence, in-depth analyses are needed to establish whether they are well calibrated.
METHOD: In this paper, we demonstrate the use of DNN-based classification tools to benefit cancer registries by automating information extraction of disease at diagnosis and at surgery from electronic text pathology reports from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based cancer registries. In particular, we introduce multiple methods for selective classification to achieve a target level of accuracy on multiple classification tasks while minimizing the rejection amount-that is, the number of electronic pathology reports for which the model's predictions are unreliable. We evaluate the proposed methods by comparing our approach with the current in-house deep learning-based abstaining classifier.
RESULTS: Overall, all the proposed selective classification methods effectively allow for achieving the targeted level of accuracy or higher in a trade-off analysis aimed to minimize the rejection rate. On in-distribution validation and holdout test data, with all the proposed methods, we achieve on all tasks the required target level of accuracy with a lower rejection rate than the deep abstaining classifier (DAC). Interpreting the results for the out-of-distribution test data is more complex; nevertheless, in this case as well, the rejection rate from the best among the proposed methods achieving 97% accuracy or higher is lower than the rejection rate based on the DAC.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that although both approaches can flag those samples that should be manually reviewed and labeled by human annotators, the newly proposed methods retain a larger fraction and do so without retraining-thus offering a reduced computational cost compared with the in-house deep learning-based abstaining classifier.",other,Not specified

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 6435 screening mammograms in 2096 female patients (median age, 56.4 years ± 11.2 [SD]) enrolled in a hospital-based case-control study from 2006 to 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Pathologically confirmed breast cancer was the primary outcome. Mirai scores were the primary predictors. Breast density and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment categories were comparative predictors. Performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and concordance index analyses.
RESULTS: Mirai achieved 1- and 5-year AUCs of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.74) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.67), respectively. One-year AUCs for nondense versus dense breasts were 0.72 versus 0.58 (P = .10). There was no evidence of a difference in near-term discrimination performance between BI-RADS and Mirai (1-year AUC, 0.73 vs 0.68; P = .34). For longer-term prediction (2-5 years), Mirai outperformed BI-RADS assessment (5-year AUC, 0.63 vs 0.54; P &lt; .001). Using only images of the unaffected breast reduced the discriminatory performance of the DL model (P &lt; .001 at all time points), suggesting that its predictions are likely dependent on the detection of ipsilateral premalignant patterns.
CONCLUSION: A mammography DL model showed good performance in a high-risk external dataset enriched for African American patients, benign breast disease, and BRCA mutation carriers, and study findings suggest that the model performance is likely driven by the detection of precancerous changes.Keywords: Breast, Cancer, Computer Applications, Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Learning Algorithms, Informatics, Epidemiology, Machine Learning, Mammography, Oncology, Radiomics Supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2023See also commentary by Kontos and Kalpathy-Cramer in this issue.",other,Not specified

Retinal vessel calibre in retinal photographs is associated with cardiovascular risk and automated measurements may aid CVD risk prediction.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 860 Chinese, Malay and Indian participants aged 40-80 years with CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2] who attended the baseline visit (2004-2011) of the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study. Retinal vessel calibre measurements were obtained by a deep learning system (DLS). Incident CVD [non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and death due to MI, stroke and other CVD] in those who were free of CVD at baseline was ascertained until 31 December 2019. Risk factors (established, kidney, and retinal features) were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Model performance was assessed for discrimination, fit, and net reclassification improvement (NRI).
RESULTS: Incident CVD occurred in 289 (33.6%) over mean follow-up of 9.3 (4.3) years. After adjusting for established cardiovascular risk factors, eGFR [adjusted HR 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99)] and retinal arteriolar narrowing [adjusted HR 1.40 (95% CI: 1.17-1.68)], but not venular dilation, were independent predictors for CVD in CKD. The addition of eGFR and retinal features to established cardiovascular risk factors improved model discrimination with significantly better fit and better risk prediction according to the low (<15%), intermediate (15-29.9%), and high (30% or more) risk categories (NRI 5.8%), and with higher risk thresholds (NRI 12.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Retinal vessel calibre measurements by DLS were significantly associated with incident CVD independent of established CVD risk factors. Addition of kidney function and retinal vessel calibre parameters may improve CVD risk prediction among Asians with CKD.",other,Not specified

To estimate the prognosis of LLM patients and assess its efficacy, we used a powerful deep learning and neural network approach called DeepSurv.
METHODS: We gathered data on those who had an LLM diagnosis between 2000 and 2019 from the SEER database. We divided the people into training and testing cohorts at a 7:3 ratio using a random selection technique. To assess the likelihood that LLM patients would survive, we compared the results of the DeepSurv model with those of the Cox proportional-hazards (CoxPH) model. Calibration curves, the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the concordance index (C-index) were all used to assess how accurate the predictions were.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 26,243 LLM patients were enrolled, with 7873 serving as the testing cohort and 18,370 as the training cohort. Significant correlations with age, gender, AJCC stage, chemotherapy status, surgery status, regional lymph node removal and the survival outcomes of LLM patients were found by the CoxPH model. The CoxPH model's C-index was 0.766, which signifies a good degree of predicted accuracy. Additionally, we created the DeepSurv model using the training cohort data, which had a higher C-index of 0.852. In addition to calculating the 3-, 5-, and 8-year AUC values, the predictive performance of both models was evaluated. The equivalent AUC values for the CoxPH model were 0.795, 0.767, and 0.847, respectively. The DeepSurv model, in comparison, had better AUC values of 0.872, 0.858, and 0.847. In comparison to the CoxPH model, the DeepSurv model demonstrated greater prediction performance for LLM patients, as shown by the AUC values and the calibration curve.
CONCLUSION: We created the DeepSurv model using LLM patient data from the SEER database, which performed better than the CoxPH model in predicting the survival time of LLM patients.",transformer/generative,Not specified

METHODS: In the population-based cohort study, we collected clinical characteristics from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. According to the time of diagnosis, the SEER data were divided into 2 cohorts: the training cohort (from 2010 to 2016) and the test cohort (from 2017 to 2019). The training cohort was used to train a deep learning-based predictive model derived from DeepSurv theory, which was validated by both the training and the test cohorts. All clinical characteristics were included and analyzed using Cox proportional risk regression or Kaplan-Meier curve to determine the risk factors and protective factors of MPM.
RESULTS: The survival model included 3,130 cases (2,208 in the training cohort and 922 in the test cohort). As for model's performance, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was 0.7037 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7030-0.7045] in the training cohort and 0.7076 (95% CI: 0.7067-0.7086) in the test cohort. Older age; male sex, sarcomatoid mesothelioma; and T4, N2, and M1 stage tended to be the risk factors for survival. Meanwhile, epithelioid mesothelioma, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy tended to be the protective factors. The median overall survival (OS) of patients who underwent surgery combined with radiotherapy was the longest, followed by those who underwent a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning-based model precisely could predict the survival of patients with MPM; moreover, multimode combination therapy might provide more meaningful survival benefits.",other,Not specified

Stochastic models are deemed more appropriate than deterministic models accounting in terms of essential and practical information about a system. The objective of the current investigation is to address the issue above through the development of a novel deep neural network referred to as a stochastic epidemiology-informed neural network. This network learns knowledge about the parameters and dynamics of a stochastic epidemic vaccine model. Our analysis centers on examining the nonlinear incidence rate of the model from the perspective of the combined effects of vaccination and stochasticity. Based on empirical evidence, stochastic models offer a more comprehensive understanding than deterministic models, mainly when we use error metrics. The findings of our study indicate that a decrease in randomness and an increase in vaccination rates are associated with a better prediction of nonlinear incidence rates. Adopting a nonlinear incidence rate enables a more comprehensive representation of the complexities of transmitting diseases. The computational analysis of the proposed method, focusing on sensitivity analysis and overfitting analysis, shows that the proposed method is efficient. Our research aims to guide policymakers on the effects of stochasticity in epidemic models, thereby aiding the development of effective vaccination and mitigation policies.

Although this expansion clearly represents a remarkable opportunity for the sector, it conceals a multitude of challenges. Pollution and land erosion, competition for limited resources between animal and human nutrition, animal welfare concerns, limitations on the use of growth promoters and antimicrobial agents, and increasing risks and effects of animal infectious diseases and zoonoses are several topics that have received attention from authorities and the public. The increase in poultry production must be achieved mainly through optimization and increased efficiency. The increasing ability to generate large amounts of data (""big data"") is pervasive in both modern society and the farming industry. Information accessibility-coupled with the availability of tools and computational power to store, share, integrate, and analyze data with automatic and flexible algorithms-offers an unprecedented opportunity to develop tools to maximize farm profitability, reduce socio-environmental impacts, and increase animal and human health and welfare. A detailed description of all topics and applications of big data analysis in poultry farming would be infeasible. Therefore, the present work briefly reviews the application of sensor technologies, such as optical, acoustic, and wearable sensors, as well as infrared thermal imaging and optical flow, to poultry farming. The principles and benefits of advanced statistical techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, and their use in developing effective and reliable classification and prediction models to benefit the farming system, are also discussed. Finally, recent progress in pathogen genome sequencing and analysis is discussed, highlighting practical applications in epidemiological tracking, and reconstruction of microorganisms' population dynamics, evolution, and spread. The benefits of the objective evaluation of the effectiveness of applied control strategies are also considered. Although human-artificial intelligence collaborations in the livestock sector can be frightening because they require farmers and employees in the sector to adapt to new roles, challenges, and competencies-and because several unknowns, limitations, and open-ended questions are inevitable-their overall benefits appear to be far greater than their drawbacks. As more farms and companies connect to technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and sensing technologies will begin to play a greater role in identifying patterns and solutions to pressing problems in modern animal farming, thus providing remarkable production-based and commercial advantages. Moreover, the combination of diverse sources and types of data will also become fundamental for the development of predictive models able to anticipate, rather than merely detect, disease occurrence. The increasing availability of sensors, infrastructures, and tools for big data collection, storage, sharing, and analysis-together with the use of open standards and integration with pathogen molecular epidemiology-have the potential to address the major challenge of producing higher-quality, more healthful food on a larger scale in a more sustainable manner, thereby protecting ecosystems, preserving natural resources, and improving animal and human welfare and health.",other,Not specified

To overcome the limitations of regression analysis, a deep learning-based analysis pipeline was developed. Study Design and Setting: Lumpectomy (breast-conserving surgery) and mastectomy are the two most commonly used surgical procedures for early-stage female breast cancer patients. An emulation trial was designed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data to evaluate their relative effectiveness in overall survival. The analysis pipeline consisted of a propensity score step, a weighted survival analysis step, and a bootstrap inference step. Results: A total of 65,997 subjects were enrolled in the emulated trial, with 50,704 and 15,293 in the lumpectomy and mastectomy arms, respectively.

An efficient clinical tool that can accurately predict patient prognosis is not available. The current study aimed to use deep learning algorithms to develop a prediction model for the prognosis of patients with long bone sarcoma.
METHODS: Data of patients with long bone sarcoma in the extremities was collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database from 2004 to 2014. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to select possible prediction features. DeepSurv, a deep learning model, was constructed for predicting cancer-specific survival rates. In addition, the classical cox proportional hazards model was established for comparison. The predictive accuracy of our models was assessed using the C-index, Integrated Brier Score, receiver operating characteristic curve, and calibration curve.
RESULTS: Age, tumor extension, histological grade, tumor size, surgery, and distant metastasis were associated with cancer-specific survival in patients with long bone sarcoma. According to loss function values, our models converged successfully and effectively learned the survival data of the training cohort. Based on the C-index, area under the curve, calibration curve, and Integrated Brier Score, the deep learning model was more accurate and flexible in predicting survival rates than the cox proportional hazards model.
CONCLUSION: A deep learning model for predicting the survival probability of patients with long bone sarcoma was constructed and validated. It is more accurate and flexible in predicting prognosis than the classical CoxPH model.",other,Not specified

For the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, such models predict that at large times equilibrium is reached exponentially. However, epidemiological data from Europe suggest that this approach is algebraic. Indeed, accurate long-term predictions have been obtained via a forecasting model only if it uses an algebraic as opposed to the standard exponential formula. In this work, by allowing those parameters of the SEIR model that reflect behavioural aspects (e.g. spatial distancing) to vary nonlinearly with the extent of the epidemic, we construct a model which exhibits asymptoticly algebraic behaviour. Interestingly, the emerging power law is consistent with the typical dynamics observed in various social settings. In addition, using reliable epidemiological data, we solve in a numerically robust way the inverse problem of determining all model parameters characterizing our novel model. Finally, using deep learning, we demonstrate that the algebraic forecasting model used earlier is optimal.",other,Not specified

Still, there is a demand for tools that are less computationally intensive and that can classify viruses down to the ranks of genus and species. Cressdnaviruses are good subjects for testing such tools, due to their small, circular genomes and the existence of several families and genera with a highly imbalanced number of species. We developed a 2D convolutional neural network for virus taxonomy and tested it for classification of viruses from the phylum Cressdnaviricota.

Taking COVID-19 as an example, accurate prediction of infection can assist experts in effectively allocating medical resources and diagnosing diseases. Currently, scholars worldwide use single model approaches or epidemiology models more often to predict the outbreak trend of COVID-19, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. Although a few studies have employed ensemble models, there is still room for improvement in their performance. In addition, there are only a few models that use the laboratory results of patients to predict COVID-19 infection. To address these issues, research efforts should focus on improving disease prediction performance and expanding the use of medical disease prediction models. In this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning model Whale Optimization Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) called WOCLSA which incorporates three models ANN, CNN and LSTM. The WOCLSA model utilizes the Whale Optimization Algorithm to optimize the neuron number, dropout and batch size parameters in the integrated model of ANN, CNN and LSTM, thereby finding the global optimal solution parameters. WOCLSA employs 18 patient indicators as predictors, and compares its results with three other ensemble deep learning models. All models were validated with train-test split approaches. We evaluate and compare our proposed model and other models using accuracy, F1 score, recall, AUC and precision metrics. Through many studies and tests, our results show that our prediction models can identify patients with COVID-19 infection at the AUC of 91%, 91%, and 93% respectively. Other prediction results achieve a respectable accuracy of 92.82%, 92.79%, and 91.66% respectively, f1-score of 93.41%, 92.79%, and 92.33% respectively, precision of 93.41%, 92.79%, and 92.33% respectively, recall of 93.41%, 92.79%, and 92.33% respectively. All of these exceed 91%, surpassing those of comparable models. The execution time of WOCLSA is also an advantage.

It's necessary to compare GCC prognosis with other gastric sites carcinoma and set up an effective prognostic model based on a neural network to predict the survival of GCC patients.
METHODS: In the population-based cohort study, we first enrolled the clinical features from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data (n = 31,397) as well as the public Chinese data from different hospitals (n = 1049). Then according to the diagnostic time, the SEER data were then divided into two cohorts, the train cohort (patients were diagnosed as GCC in 2010-2014, n = 4414) and the test cohort (diagnosed in 2015, n = 957). Age, sex, pathology, tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage, tumor size, surgery or not, radiotherapy or not, chemotherapy or not and history of malignancy were chosen as the predictive clinical features. The train cohort was utilized to conduct the neural network-based prognostic predictive model which validated by itself and the test cohort. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was used to evaluate model performance.
RESULTS: The prognosis of GCC patients in SEER database was worse than that of non GCC (NGCC) patients, while it was not worse in the Chinese data. The total of 5371 patients were used to conduct the model, following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Neural network-based prognostic predictive model had a satisfactory performance for GCC overall survival (OS) prediction, which owned 0.7431 AUC in the train cohort (95% confidence intervals, CI, 0.7423-0.7439) and 0.7419 in the test cohort (95% CI, 0.7411-0.7428).
CONCLUSIONS: GCC patients indeed have different survival time compared with non GCC patients. And the neural network-based prognostic predictive tool developed in this study is a novel and promising software for the clinical outcome analysis of GCC patients.",other,Not specified

METHODS: We demonstrated the use of an ML-based emulator with the Colorectal Cancer (CRC)-Adenoma Incidence and Mortality (CRC-AIM) model, which includes 23 unknown natural history input parameters to replicate the CRC epidemiology in the United States. We first generated 15,000 input combinations and ran the CRC-AIM model to evaluate CRC incidence, adenoma size distribution, and the percentage of small adenoma detected by colonoscopy. We then used this data set to train several ML algorithms, including deep neural network (DNN), random forest, and several gradient boosting variants (i.e., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and compared their performance. We evaluated 10 million potential input combinations using the selected emulator and examined input combinations that best estimated observed calibration targets. Furthermore, we cross-validated outcomes generated by the CRC-AIM model with those made by CISNET models. The calibrated CRC-AIM model was externally validated using the United Kingdom Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial (UKFSST).
RESULTS: The DNN with proper preprocessing outperformed other tested ML algorithms and successfully predicted all 8 outcomes for different input combinations. It took 473 s for the trained DNN to predict outcomes for 10 million inputs, which would have required 190 CPU-years without our DNN. The overall calibration process took 104 CPU-days, which included building the data set, training, selecting, and hyperparameter tuning of the ML algorithms. While 7 input combinations had acceptable fit to the targets, a combination that best fits all outcomes was selected as the best vector. Almost all of the predictions made by the best vector laid within those from the CISNET models, demonstrating CRC-AIM's cross-model validity. Similarly, CRC-AIM accurately predicted the hazard ratios of CRC incidence and mortality as reported by UKFSST, demonstrating its external validity. Examination of the impact of calibration targets suggested that the selection of the calibration target had a substantial impact on model outcomes in terms of life-year gains with screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Emulators such as a DNN that is meticulously selected and trained can substantially reduce the computational burden of calibrating complex microsimulation models.
HIGHLIGHTS: Calibrating a microsimulation model, a process to find unobservable parameters so that the model fits observed data, is computationally complex.We used a deep neural network model, a popular machine learning algorithm, to calibrate the Colorectal Cancer Adenoma Incidence and Mortality (CRC-AIM) model.We demonstrated that our approach provides an efficient and accurate method to significantly speed up calibration in microsimulation models.The calibration process successfully provided cross-model validation of CRC-AIM against 3 established CISNET models and also externally validated against a randomized controlled trial.",other,Not specified

We aimed to establish prognostic models using a deep learning algorithm for survival prediction.
METHODS: We collected 11,168 PGIL patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to form the training and test cohorts. At the same time, we collected 82 PGIL patients from three medical centres to form the external validation cohort. We constructed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model, random survival forest (RSF) model, and neural multitask logistic regression (DeepSurv) model to predict PGIL patients' overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates of PGIL patients in the SEER database were 77.1%, 69.4%, 63.7%, and 50.3%, respectively. The RSF model based on all variables showed that the top three most important variables for predicting OS were age, histological type, and chemotherapy. The independent risk factors for PGIL patient prognosis included sex, age, race, primary site, Ann Arbor stage, histological type, symptom, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, according to the Lasso regression analysis. Using these factors, we built the CoxPH and DeepSurv models. The DeepSurv model's C-index values were 0.760 in the training cohort, 0.742 in the test cohort, and 0.707 in the external validation cohort, which demonstrated that the DeepSurv model performed better compared to the RSF model (0.728) and the CoxPH model (0.724). The DeepSurv model accurately predicted 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year OS. Both calibration curves and decision curve analysis curves demonstrated the superior performance of the DeepSurv model. We developed the DeepSurv model as an online web calculator for survival prediction, which can be accessed at http://124.222.228.112:8501/ .
CONCLUSIONS: This DeepSurv model with external validation is superior to previous studies in predicting short-term and long-term survival and can help us make better-individualized decisions for PGIL patients.",other,Not specified

METHODS: In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, brain microbleeds were identified from 3T magnetic resonance imaging susceptibility-weighted imaging sequences using deep learning models followed by radiologist review.
RESULTS: Among 1016 participants without prior stroke (25% Black, 15% Chinese, 19% Hispanic, 41% White, mean age 72), microbleed prevalence was 20% at age 60 to 64.9 and 45% at ≥85 years. Deep microbleeds were associated with older age, hypertension, higher body mass index, and atrial fibrillation, and lobar microbleeds with male sex and atrial fibrillation. Overall, microbleeds were associated with greater white matter hyperintensity volume and lower total white matter fractional anisotropy.

METHODS: This is a population-based analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients with T1 bladder cancer (BC) who underwent transurethral resection of the tumour (TURBT) between 2004 and 2015 were included in the analysis. The predictive abilities of LR and ANN were compared.
RESULTS: Overall 32,060 patients with T1 BC were randomly assigned to training and validation cohorts in the proportion of 70:30. There were 5691 (17.75%) cancer-specific deaths and 18,485 (57.7%) all-cause deaths within a median of 116 months of follow-up (IQR 80-153). Multivariable analysis with LR revealed that age, race, tumour grade, histology variant, the primary character, location and size of the tumour, marital status, and annual income constitute independent risk factors for CSS. In the validation cohort, LR and ANN yielded 79.5% and 79.4% accuracy in 5-year CSS prediction respectively. The area under the ROC curve for CSS predictions reached 73.4% and 72.5% for LR and ANN respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Available risk factors might be useful to estimate the risk of CSS and OS and thus facilitate optimal treatment choice. The accuracy of survival prediction is still moderate. T1 BC with adverse features requires more aggressive treatment after initial TURBT.",other,Not specified

METHOD: From the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, AYA women with primary breast cancer diagnosed from 2010 to 2018 were included in our study. A deep learning algorithm, referred to as DeepSurv, was used to construct a prognostic predictive model based on 19 variables, including demographic and clinical information. Harrell's C-index, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and calibration plots were adopted to comprehensively assess the predictive performance of the prognostic predictive model. Then, a novel clinical risk stratification was constructed based on the total risk score derived from the prognostic predictive model. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves for patients with different death risks, using the log-rank test to compared the survival disparities. Decision curve analyses (DCAs) were adopted to evaluate the clinical utility of the prognostic predictive model.
RESULTS: Among 14,243 AYA women with breast cancer finally included in this study, 10,213 (71.7%) were White and the median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 36 (32-38) years. The prognostic predictive model based on DeepSurv presented high C-indices in both the training cohort [0.831 (95% CI 0.819-0.843)] and the test cohort [0.791 (95% CI 0.764-0.818)]. Similar results were observed in ROC curves. The excellent agreement between the predicted and actual OS at 3 and 5 years were both achieved in the calibration plots. The obvious survival disparities were observed according to the clinical risk stratification based on the total risk score derived from the prognostic predictive model. DCAs also showed that the risk stratification possessed a significant positive net benefit in the practical ranges of threshold probabilities. Lastly, a user-friendly Web-based calculator was generated to visualize the prognostic predictive model.
CONCLUSION: A prognostic predictive model with sufficient prediction accuracy was construct for predicting OS of AYA women with breast cancer. Given its public accessibility and easy-to-use operation, the clinical risk stratification based on the total risk score derived from the prognostic predictive model may help clinicians to make better-individualized management.",other,Not specified

As viruses have highly mutable genomes, new viruses may emerge in the future, such as COVID-19 and influenza. Traditional virology relies on predefined rules to identify viruses, but new viruses may be completely or partially divergent from the reference genome, rendering statistical methods and similarity calculations insufficient for all genome sequences. Identifying DNA/RNA-based viral sequences is a crucial step in differentiating different types of lethal pathogens, including their variants and strains. While various tools in bioinformatics can align them, expert biologists are required to interpret the results. Computational virology is a scientific field that studies viruses, their origins, and drug discovery, where machine learning plays a crucial role in extracting domain- and task-specific features to tackle this challenge. This paper proposes a genome analysis system that uses advanced deep learning to identify dozens of viruses. The system uses nucleotide sequences from the NCBI GenBank database and a BERT tokenizer to extract features from the sequences by breaking them down into tokens. We also generated synthetic data for viruses with small sample sizes. The proposed system has two components: a scratch BERT architecture specifically designed for DNA analysis, which is used to learn the next codons unsupervised, and a classifier that identifies important features and understands the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Our system achieved an accuracy of 97.69% in identifying viral sequences.",other,Not specified

There is no accurate predictive method for its prognosis. Artificial intelligence deep learning may bring new hope.
METHODS: By searching the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER), 21,093 patients' clinical data were eventually included. Data were then divided into two groups (train dataset/test dataset). The train dataset (diagnosed in 2010-2014, N = 17,296) was utilized to conduct a deep learning survival model, validated by itself and the test dataset (diagnosed in 2015, N = 3,797) in parallel. According to clinical experience, age, sex, tumor site, T, N, M stage (7th American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM stage), tumor size, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and history of malignancy were chosen as predictive clinical features. The C-index was the main indicator to evaluate model performance.
RESULTS: The predictive model had a 0.7181 C-index (95% confidence intervals, CIs, 0.7174-0.7187) in the train dataset and a 0.7208 C-index (95% CIs, 0.7202-0.7215) in the test dataset. These indicated that it had a reliable predictive value on OS for SCLC, so it was then packaged as a Windows software which is free for doctors, researchers, and patients to use.
CONCLUSION: The interpretable deep learning survival predictive tool for small cell lung cancer developed by this study had a reliable predictive value on their overall survival. More biomarkers may help improve the prognostic predictive performance of small cell lung cancer.",other,Not specified

We validated and visualized the novel staging system based on DeepSurv using data from multiple cohorts.
METHODS: Totally 6020 ESCC patients diagnosed from January 2010 to December 2018 were included in the present study from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER), randomly assigned to the training and test cohorts. We developed, validated and visualized a deep learning model that included 16 prognostic factors; then a novel staging system was further constructed based on the total risk score derived from the deep learning model. The classification performance at 3-year and 5-year OS was assessed by the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Calibration curve and the Harrell's concordance index (C-index) were also used to comprehensively assess the predictive performance of the deep learning model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was utilized to assess the clinical utility of the novel staging system.
RESULTS: A more applicable and accurate deep learning model was established, which outperformed the traditional nomogram in predicting OS in the test cohort (C-index: 0.732 [95% CI 0.714-0.750] versus 0.671 [95% CI 0.647-0.695]). The ROC curves at 3-year and 5-year OS for the model also showed good discrimination ability in the test cohort (Area Under the Curve [AUC] at 3-/5-year OS = 0.805/0.825). Moreover, using our novel staging system, we observed a clear survival difference among different risk groups (P < 0.001) and a significant positive net benefit in the DCA.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel deep learning-based staging system was constructed for patients with ESCC, which performed a significant discriminability for survival probability. Moreover, an easy-to-use web-based tool based on the deep learning model was also implemented, offering convenience for personalized survival prediction. We developed a deep learning-based system that stages patients with ESCC according to their survival probability. We also created a web-based tool that uses this system to predict individual survival outcomes.",other,Not specified

It is the most aggressive type of diffuse glioma and has a median survival of months after treatment. This study aims to assess the accuracy of different novel deep learning models trained on a set of simple clinical, demographic, and surgical variables to assist in clinical practice, even in areas with constrained health care infrastructure.
METHODS: Our study included 37,095 patients with GBM from the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database. All predictors were based on demographic, clinicopathologic, and treatment information of the cases. Our outcomes of interest were months of survival and vital status. Concordance index (C-index) and integrated Brier scores (IBS) were used to evaluate the performance of the models.
RESULTS: The patient characteristics and the statistical analyses were consistent with the epidemiologic literature. The models C-index and IBS ranged from 0.6743 to 0.6918 and from 0.0934 to 0.1034, respectively. Probabilistic matrix factorization (0.6918), multitask logistic regression (0.6916), and logistic hazard (0.6916) had the highest C-index scores. The models with the lowest IBS were the probabilistic matrix factorization (0.0934), multitask logistic regression (0.0935), and logistic hazard (0.0936). These models had an accuracy (1-IBS) of 90.66%; 90.65%, and 90.64%, respectively. The deep learning algorithms were deployed on an interactive Web-based tool for practical use available via https://glioblastoma-survanalysis.herokuapp.com/.

Deep learning-based models may not perform optimally in real-world populations due to variations in variables and characteristics. Transfer learning, on the other hand, enables a model developed for one domain to be adapted for a related domain. Our objective was to integrate deep learning and transfer learning to create a multivariable survival model for lung cancer.
METHODS: We collected data from 601,480 lung cancer patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and 4,512 lung cancer patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (GYFY) database. The primary model was trained with the SEER database, internally validated with a dataset from SEER, and externally validated through transfer learning with the GYFY database. The performance of the model was compared with a traditional Cox model by C-indexes. We also explored the model's performance in the setting of missing data and generated the artificial intelligence (AI) certainty of the prediction.
RESULTS: The C-indexes in the training dataset (SEER full sample) with DeepSurv and Cox model were 0.792 (0.791-0.792) and 0.714 (0.713-0.715), respectively. The values were 0.727 (0.704-0.750) and 0.692 (0.666-0.718) after applying the trained model in the test dataset (GYFY). The AI certainty of the DeepSurv model output was from 0.98 to 1. For transfer learning through fine-tuning, the results showed that the test set could achieve a higher C-index (20% vs. 30% fine-tuning data) with more fine-tuning dataset. Besides, the DeepSurv model was more accurate than the traditional Cox model in predicting with missing data, after random data loss of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and median fill-in missing values.
CONCLUSIONS: The model outperformed the traditional Cox model, was robust with missing data and provided the AI certainty of prediction. It can be used for patient self-evaluation and risk stratification in clinical trials. Researchers can fine-tune the pre-trained model and integrate their own database to explore other prognostic factors.",other,Not specified

METHODS: A total of 2501 cervical adenocarcinoma patients from the surveillance, epidemiology and end results database and 220 patients from Qilu hospital were enrolled in this study. We created our deep learning (DL) model to manipulate the data and evaluated its performance against four other competitive models. We tried to demonstrate a new grouping system oriented by survival outcomes and process personalized survival prediction by using our DL model.
RESULTS: The DL model reached 0.878 c-index and 0.09 Brier score in the test set, which was better than the other four models. In the external test set, our model achieved a 0.80 c-index and 0.13 Brier score. Thus, we developed prognosis-oriented risk grouping for patients according to risk scores computed by our DL model. Notable differences among groupings were observed. In addition, a personalized survival prediction system based on our risk-scoring grouping was developed.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a deep neural network model for cervical adenocarcinoma patients. The performance of this model proved to be superior to other models. The results of external validation supported the possibility that the model can be used in clinical work.

We aimed to derive an improved polygenic score (PGS) for predicting children at risk of HM and to test if a PGS is predictive of MMD after accounting for SER.
METHODS: The PGS was derived from genome-wide association studies in participants of UK Biobank, CREAM Consortium, and Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging. MMD severity was quantified by a deep learning algorithm. Prediction of HM was quantified as the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). Prediction of severe MMD was assessed by logistic regression.
FINDINGS: In independent samples of European, African, South Asian and East Asian ancestry, the PGS explained 19% (95% confidence interval 17-21%), 2% (1-3%), 8% (7-10%) and 6% (3-9%) of the variation in SER, respectively. The AUROC for HM in these samples was 0.78 (0.75-0.81), 0.58 (0.53-0.64), 0.71 (0.69-0.74) and 0.67 (0.62-0.72), respectively. The PGS was not associated with the risk of MMD after accounting for SER: OR = 1.07 (0.92-1.24).
INTERPRETATION: Performance of the PGS approached the level required for clinical utility in Europeans but not in other ancestries. A PGS for refractive error was not predictive of MMD risk once SER was accounted for.

METHODS: We collected information on patients with CMM between 2004 and 2015 from the SEER database. We then randomly divided the patients into training and testing cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. The likelihood that patients with CMM will survive was forecasted using the DeepSurv model, and its results were compared with those of the Cox proportional-hazards (CoxPH) model. The calibration curves, time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and concordance index (C-index) were used to assess the prediction abilities of the model.
RESULTS: This study comprised 37,758 patients with CMM: 26,430 in the training cohort and 11,329 in the testing cohort. The CoxPH model demonstrated that the survival of patients with CMM was significantly influenced by age, sex, marital status, summary stage, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, postoperative lymph node dissection, tumor size, and tumor extension. The C-index of the CoxPH model was 0.875. We also constructed the DeepSurv model using the data from the training cohort, and its C-index was 0.910. We examined how well the aforementioned two models predicted outcomes. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year AUCs were 0.928, 0.837, and 0.855, respectively, for the CoxPH model, and 0.971, 0.947, and 0.942 for the DeepSurv model. The DeepSurv model presented a greater predictive effect on patients with CMM, and its reliability was better than that of the CoxPH model according to both the AUC value and the calibration curve.

The efficacy and collateral damage of pandemic policies are dependent on constantly evolving viral epidemiology as well as the volatile distribution of socioeconomic and cultural factors. This study proposes a data-driven approach to quantify the efficacy of the type, duration, and stringency of COVID-19 mitigation policies in terms of transmission control and economic loss, personalised to individual countries.
METHODS: We present What If…?, a deep learning pandemic-policy-decision-support algorithm simulating pandemic scenarios to guide and evaluate policy impact in real time. It leverages a uniquely diverse live global data-stream of socioeconomic, demographic, climatic, and epidemic trends on over a year of data (04/2020-06/2021) from 116 countries. The economic damage of the policies is also evaluated on the 29 higher income countries for which data is available. The efficacy and economic damage estimates are derived from two neural networks that infer respectively the daily R-value (RE) and unemployment rate (UER). Reinforcement learning then pits these models against each other to find the optimal policies minimising both RE and UER.
FINDINGS: The models made high accuracy predictions of RE and UER (average mean squared errors of 0.043 [CI95: 0.042-0.044] and 4.473% [CI95: 2.619-6.326] respectively), which allow the computation of country-specific policy efficacy in terms of cost and benefit. In the 29 countries where economic information was available, the reinforcement learning agent suggested a policy mix that is predicted to outperform those implemented in reality by over 10-fold for RE reduction (0.250 versus 0.025) and at 28-fold less cost in terms of UER (1.595% versus 0.057%).

This study aimed to develop and validate survival prediction models for gastric adenocarcinoma patients using the deep learning survival neural network.
METHODS: A total of 14,177 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were included in the study and randomly divided into the training and testing group with a 7:3 ratio. Two algorithms were chosen to build the prediction models, and both algorithms include random survival forest (RSF) and a deep learning based-survival prediction algorithm (DeepSurv).

With the recent global pandemic of COVID-19, the need to research strategies to treat these health problems has become even more pressing. Although the literature on big data and data science in health has grown rapidly, few studies have synthesized these individual studies, and none has identified the utility of big data in infectious disease surveillance and modeling.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to synthesize research and identify hotspots of big data in infectious disease epidemiology.
METHODS: Bibliometric data from 3054 documents that satisfied the inclusion criteria retrieved from the Web of Science database over 22 years (2000-2022) were analyzed and reviewed. The search retrieval occurred on October 17, 2022. Bibliometric analysis was performed to illustrate the relationships between research constituents, topics, and key terms in the retrieved documents.
RESULTS: The bibliometric analysis revealed internet searches and social media as the most utilized big data sources for infectious disease surveillance or modeling. The analysis also placed US and Chinese institutions as leaders in this research area. Disease monitoring and surveillance, utility of electronic health (or medical) records, methodology framework for infodemiology tools, and machine/deep learning were identified as the core research themes.
CONCLUSIONS: Proposals for future studies are made based on these findings. This study will provide health care informatics scholars with a comprehensive understanding of big data research in infectious disease epidemiology.",other,Not specified

Epub 2023 Mar 9.,Yang Y,Eur Radiol,2023,2023/03/09,,,10.1007/s00330-023-09515-1,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning system (DLS) by using an auxiliary section that extracts and outputs specific ultrasound diagnostic features to improve the explainable, clinical relevant utility of using DLS for detecting NAFLD.
METHODS: In a community-based study of 4144 participants with abdominal ultrasound scan in Hangzhou, China, we sampled 928 (617 [66.5%] females, mean age: 56 years ± 13 [standard deviation]) participants (2 images per participant) to develop and validate DLS, a two-section neural network (2S-NNet). Radiologists' consensus diagnosis classified hepatic steatosis as none steatosis, mild, moderate, and severe. We also explored the NAFLD detection performance of six one-section neural network models and five fatty liver indices on our data set. We further evaluated the influence of participants' characteristics on the correctness of 2S-NNet by logistic regression.
RESULTS: Area under the curve (AUROC) of 2S-NNet for hepatic steatosis was 0.90 for ≥ mild, 0.85 for ≥ moderate, and 0.93 for severe steatosis, and was 0.90 for NAFLD presence, 0.84 for moderate to severe NAFLD, and 0.93 for severe NAFLD. The AUROC of NAFLD severity was 0.88 for 2S-NNet, and 0.79-0.86 for one-section models. The AUROC of NAFLD presence was 0.90 for 2S-NNet, and 0.54-0.82 for fatty liver indices. Age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, fibrosis-4 index, android fat ratio, and skeletal muscle via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry had no significant impact on the correctness of 2S-NNet (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: By using two-section design, 2S-NNet had improved the performance for detecting NAFLD with more explainable, clinical relevant utility than using one-section design.
KEY POINTS: • Based on the consensus review derived from radiologists, our DLS (2S-NNet) had an AUROC of 0.88 by using two-section design and yielded better performance for detecting NAFLD than using one-section design with more explainable, clinical relevant utility. • The 2S-NNet outperformed five fatty liver indices with the highest AUROCs (0.84-0.93 vs. 0.54-0.82) for different NAFLD severity screening, indicating screening utility of deep learning-based radiology may perform better than blood biomarker panels in epidemiology. • The correctness of 2S-NNet was not significantly influenced by individual's characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, fibrosis-4 index, android fat ratio, and skeletal muscle via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.",other,Not specified

Epidemiologic Information (EI) regarding prevalence and incidence data of rare diseases is sparse and current paradigms of identifying, extracting, and curating EI rely upon time-intensive, error-prone manual processes. With these limitations, a clear understanding of the variation in epidemiology and outcomes for rare disease patients is hampered. This challenges the public health of rare diseases patients through a lack of information necessary to prioritize research, policy decisions, therapeutic development, and health system allocations.
METHODS: In this study, we developed a newly curated epidemiology corpus for Named Entity Recognition (NER), a deep learning framework, and a novel rare disease epidemiologic information pipeline named EpiPipeline4RD consisting of a web interface and Restful API. For the corpus creation, we programmatically gathered a representative sample of rare disease epidemiologic abstracts, utilized weakly-supervised machine learning techniques to label the dataset, and manually validated the labeled dataset. For the deep learning framework development, we fine-tuned our dataset and adapted the BioBERT model for NER. We measured the performance of our BioBERT model for epidemiology entity recognition quantitatively with precision, recall, and F1 and qualitatively through a comparison with Orphanet. We demonstrated the ability for our pipeline to gather, identify, and extract epidemiology information from rare disease abstracts through three case studies.
RESULTS: We developed a deep learning model to extract EI with overall F1 scores of 0.817 and 0.878, evaluated at the entity-level and token-level respectively, and which achieved comparable qualitative results to Orphanet's collection paradigm. Additionally, case studies of the rare diseases Classic homocystinuria, GRACILE syndrome, Phenylketonuria demonstrated the adequate recall of abstracts with epidemiology information, high precision of epidemiology information extraction through our deep learning model, and the increased efficiency of EpiPipeline4RD compared to a manual curation paradigm.
CONCLUSIONS: EpiPipeline4RD demonstrated high performance of EI extraction from rare disease literature to augment manual curation processes. This automated information curation paradigm will not only effectively empower development of the NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD), but also support the public health of the rare disease community.",other,Not specified

Bone metastasis (BM) in patients have are known to show poor prognostic outcomes. We explored the epidemiological characteristics of BM in SCLC patients and create a new deep learning model to predict outcomes for cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for SCLC patients diagnosed with or without BM from 2010 to 2016 were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the effects of prognostic variables on OS and CSS. Through integration of these variables, nomograms were created for the prediction of CSS and OS rates at 3-month,6- month,and 12-month. Harrell's coordination index, calibration curves,and time- dependent ROC curves were used to assess the nomograms' accuracy. Decision tree analysis was used to evaluate the clinical application value of the established nomogram.
RESULTS: In this study, 4201 patients were enrolled. Male sex, tumor size 25 but <10, brain and liver metastases, as well as chemotherapy were associated with a high risk for BM. Tumor size, Age, N stage, gender, liver metastasis, radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy were shown to be prognostic variables for OS, and the prognostic variables for CSS were added to the tumor number in addition. Based on these results, nomograms for CSS and OS were established separately. Internal as well as external validation showed that the C-index, calibration cuurve and DCA had good constructive correction effect and clinical application value. Decision tree analysis further confirmed the prognostic factors of OS and CSS.
DISCUSSION: The nomogram and decision tree models developed in this study effectively guided treatment decisions for SCLC patients with BM. The creation of prediction models for BM SCLC patients may be facilitated by deep learning models.",other,Not specified

OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a practical review and tutorial on scalable causal structure learning models with examples of real-world data to help health care audiences understand and apply them.
METHODS: We reviewed traditional (combinatorial and score-based) methods for causal structure discovery and machine learning-based schemes. Various traditional approaches have been studied to tackle this problem, the most important among these being the Peter Spirtes and Clark Glymour algorithms. This was followed by analyzing the literature on score-based methods, which are computationally faster. Owing to the continuous constraint on acyclicity, there are new deep learning approaches to the problem in addition to traditional and score-based methods. Such methods can also offer scalability, particularly when there is a large amount of data involving multiple variables. Using our own evaluation metrics and experiments on linear, nonlinear, and benchmark Sachs data, we aimed to highlight the various advantages and disadvantages associated with these methods for the health care community. We also highlighted recent developments in biomedicine where causal structure learning can be applied to discover structures such as gene networks, brain connectivity networks, and those in cancer epidemiology.
RESULTS: We also compared the performance of traditional and machine learning-based algorithms for causal discovery over some benchmark data sets. Directed Acyclic Graph-Graph Neural Network has the lowest structural hamming distance (19) and false positive rate (0.13) based on the Sachs data set, whereas Greedy Equivalence Search and Max-Min Hill Climbing have the best false discovery rate (0.68) and true positive rate (0.56), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning-based approaches, including deep learning, have many advantages over traditional approaches, such as scalability, including a greater number of variables, and potentially being applied in a wide range of biomedical applications, such as genetics, if sufficient data are available. Furthermore, these models are more flexible than traditional models and are poised to positively affect many applications in the future.",other,Not specified

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, deep learning (DL) and freeze-and-grow (FG) methods were optimized and applied to automatically detect airways at low-dose CT. Four data sets were used: two data sets consisting of matching standard- and low-dose CT scans from the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) phase II (2014-2017) cohort (n = 2 × 236; mean age ± SD, 70 years ± 9; 123 women); one data set consisting of low-dose CT scans from the COPDGene phase III (2018-2020) cohort (n = 335; mean age ± SD, 73 years ± 8; 173 women); and one data set consisting of low-dose, anonymized CT scans from the 2003 Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening trial (n = 55) acquired by using different CT scanners. Performance measures for different methods were computed and compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
RESULTS: At low-dose CT, 56 294 of 62 480 (90.1%) airways of the reference total airway count (TAC) and 32 109 of 37 864 (84.8%) airways of the peripheral TAC (TAC<sub>p</sub>), detected at standard-dose CT, were detected. Significant losses (P &lt; .001) of 14 526 of 76 453 (19.0%) airways and 884 of 6908 (12.8%) airways in the TAC and 12 256 of 43 462 (28.2%) airways and 699 of 3882 (18.0%) airways in the TAC<sub>p</sub> were observed, respectively, for the multiprotocol and multiscanner data without retraining. When using the automated low-dose CT method, TAC values of 347, 342, 323, and 266 and TAC<sub>p</sub> values of 205, 202, 289, and 141 were observed for those who have never smoked and participants at Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stages 0, 1, and 2, respectively, which were superior to the respective values previously reported for matching groups when using a semiautomated method at standard-dose CT.

METHOD: Cases diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2018 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A deep learning survival neural network was developed and validated based on 17 variables, including demographic information, clinicopathological characteristics, and treatment details. Based on the total risk score derived from this algorithm, a novel risk classification system was constructed and compared with the 8th edition of the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system.
RESULTS: Of 7,764 EAC patients eligible for the study, 6,818 (87.8%) were men and the median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (58-72) years. The deep learning model generated significantly superior predictions to the 8th edition staging system on the test data set (C-index: 0.773 [95% CI, 0.757-0.789] vs. 0.683 [95% CI, 0.667-0.699]; P &lt; 0.001). Calibration curves revealed that the deep learning model was well calibrated for 1- and 3-year OS, most points almost directly distributing on the 45° line. Decision curve analyses (DCAs) showed that the novel risk classification system exhibited a more significant positive net benefit than the TNM staging system. A user-friendly and precise web-based calculator with a portably executable file was implemented to visualize the deep learning predictive model.
CONCLUSION: A deep learning predictive model was developed and validated, which possesses more excellent calibration and discrimination abilities in survival prediction of EAC.

We propose a proof-of-concept AI-based app to help predict fluid via a ""fluid score"", prevent fluid progression, and provide personalized, serial monitoring, in the context of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) for patients at risk of retinal fluid complications.
METHODS: The app comprises a convolutional neural network-Vision Transformer (CNN-ViT)-based segmentation deep learning (DL) network, trained on a small dataset of 100 training images (augmented to 992 images) from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study, together with a CNN-based classification network trained on 8497 images, that can detect fluid vs. non-fluid optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. Both networks are validated on external datasets.
RESULTS: Internal testing for our segmentation network produced an IoU score of 83.0% (95% CI = 76.7-89.3%) and a DICE score of 90.4% (86.3-94.4%); for external testing, we obtained an IoU score of 66.7% (63.5-70.0%) and a DICE score of 78.7% (76.0-81.4%). Internal testing of our classification network produced an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 99.18%, and a Youden index threshold of 0.3806; for external testing, we obtained an AUC of 94.55%, and an accuracy of 94.98% and an F1 score of 85.73% with Youden index.
CONCLUSION: We have developed an AI-based app with an alternative transformer-based segmentation algorithm that could potentially be applied in the clinic with a PPPM approach for serial monitoring, and could allow for the generation of retrospective data to research into the varied use of treatments for AMD and DR. The modular system of our app can be scaled to add more iterative features based on user feedback for more efficient monitoring. Further study and scaling up of the algorithm dataset could potentially boost its usability in a real-world clinical setting.

METHODS: Similar to last year's edition, a PubMed search of 2021 scientific publications on PHEI has been conducted. The resulting references were reviewed by the two section editors. Then, 11 candidate best papers were selected from the initial 782 references. These papers were then peer-reviewed by selected external reviewers. They included at least two senior researchers, to allow the Editorial Committee of the 2022 IMIA Yearbook edition to make an informed decision for selecting the best papers of the PHEI section.
RESULTS: Among the 782 references retrieved from PubMed, two were selected as the best papers. The first best paper reports a study which performed a comprehensive comparison of traditional statistical approaches (e.g., Cox Proportional Hazards models) vs. machine learning techniques in a large, real-world dataset for predicting breast cancer survival, with a focus on explainability. The second paper describes the engineering of deep learning models to establish associations between ocular features and major hepatobiliary diseases and to advance automated screening and identification of hepatobiliary diseases from ocular images.
CONCLUSION: Overall, from this year edition, we observed that the number of studies related to PHEI has decreased. The findings of the two studies selected as best papers on the topic suggest that a significant effort is still being made by the community to compare traditional learning methods with deep learning methods.

We developed and validated a model to accurately classify sitting and sitting patterns using hip-worn accelerometer data from a wide age range of older adults.
METHODS: Deep learning models were trained with 30-Hz triaxial hip-worn accelerometer data as inputs and activPAL sitting/nonsitting events as ground truth. Data from 981 adults aged 35-99 years from cohorts in two continents were used to train the model, which we call CHAP-Adult (Convolutional Neural Network Hip Accelerometer Posture-Adult). Validation was conducted among 419 randomly selected adults not included in model training.
RESULTS: Mean errors (activPAL - CHAP-Adult) and 95% limits of agreement were: sedentary time -10.5 (-63.0, 42.0) min/day, breaks in sedentary time 1.9 (-9.2, 12.9) breaks/day, mean bout duration -0.6 (-4.0, 2.7) min, usual bout duration -1.4 (-8.3, 5.4) min, alpha .00 (-.04, .04), and time in ≥30-min bouts -15.1 (-84.3, 54.1) min/day. Respective mean (and absolute) percent errors were: -2.0% (4.0%), -4.7% (12.2%), 4.1% (11.6%), -4.4% (9.6%), 0.0% (1.4%), and 5.4% (9.6%).

We also investigated whether energy intake adjustment is adequate for deep learning algorithms. We constructed a deep neural network (DNN) in which the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer are experimentally selected, and we trained the DNN to diagnose hypertension using the dataset while varying the energy intake adjustment method in four ways. For comparison, we trained a decision tree in the same way. Experimental results showed that the DNN performs better than the decision tree in all aspects, such as having higher sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and accuracy. In addition, we found that unlike general machine learning algorithms, including the decision tree, the DNNs perform best when energy intake is not adjusted. The result indicates that energy intake adjustment is not required when using a deep learning algorithm to classify and predict hypertension with BP-related factors.",other,Not specified

For areas with limited testing capacity, wastewater surveillance can provide information on the disease dynamic at a community level. A predictive model is a key to generating quantitative estimates of the infected population. Modeling longitudinal wastewater data can be challenging as biomarkers in wastewater are susceptible to variations caused by multiple factors associated with the wastewater matrix and the sewersheds characteristics. As WBE is an emerging trend, the model should be able to address the uncertainties of wastewater from different sewersheds. We proposed exploiting machine learning and deep learning techniques, which are supported by the growing WBE data. In this article, we reviewed the existing predictive models, among which the emerging machine learning/deep learning models showed great potential. However, most models are built for individual sewersheds with few features extracted from the wastewater. To fulfill the research gap, we compared different time-series and non-time-series models for their short-term predictive performance of COVID-19 cases in 9 diverse sewersheds. The time-series models, long short-term memory (LSTM) and Prophet, outcompeted the non-time-series models. Besides viral (SARS-CoV-2) loads and location identity, domain-specific features like biochemical parameters of wastewater, geographical parameters of the sewersheds, and some socioeconomic parameters of the communities can contribute to the models. With proper feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, we believe machine learning models like LSTM can be a feasible solution for the COVID-19 trend prediction via WBE. Overall, this is a proof-of-concept study on the application of machine learning in COVID-19 WBE. Future studies are needed to deploy and maintain the model in more real-world applications.",other,Not specified

Multi-omics clustering was performed to identify 3 clusters of 499 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas based on immune-related gene expression and somatic mutations. The immune characteristics and biological features of the obtained clusters were revealed by bioinformatics, and 3 immune subtypes were identified: 1) adaptive immune activation subtype predominantly enriched in T cells, 2) innate immune activation subtype predominantly enriched in macrophages, and 3) immune desert subtype. Subsequently, the clinical implications of each subtype were analyzed per clinical epidemiology. We found that adaptive immune activation showed better survival outcomes and had a similar response to chemotherapy with innate immune activation, whereas immune desert might be relatively resistant to chemotherapy. Moreover, a subtype prediction system was developed by deep learning with whole slide images and named HISMD: HNSCC Immune Subtypes via Multi-omics and Deep Learning. We endowed HISMD with interpretability through image-based key feature extraction. The clinical implications, biological significances, and predictive stability of HISMD were successfully verified by using our independent multicenter cohort data set. In summary, this study revealed the immune heterogeneity of HNSCC and obtained a novel, highly accurate, and interpretable immune subtyping prediction system. For clinical implementation in the future, additional validation and utility studies are warranted.",other,Not specified

Simultaneously, to expand the sample size for further verification, we explored a deep learning algorithm to correctly classify molecular subtypes from H&E histology slides. We suggested that the renal pelvic group might have a proclivity towards luminal and the ureter towards basal and P53-like.

Several prognostic models have been created utilizing multivariate Cox regression or binary classification-based machine learning approaches to predict the 3- and 5-year survival of patients with chondrosarcoma, but few studies have investigated the results of combining deep learning with time-to-event prediction. Compared with simplifying the prediction as a binary classification problem, modeling the probability of an event as a function of time by combining it with deep learning can provide better accuracy and flexibility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma between 2000 and 2018 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. Three algorithms-two based on neural networks (DeepSurv, neural multi-task logistic regression [NMTLR]) and one on ensemble learning (random survival forest [RSF])-were selected for training. Meanwhile, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model was also constructed for comparison. The dataset was randomly divided into training and testing datasets at a ratio of 7:3. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted through a 1000-repeated random search with 5-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. The model performance was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), Brier score, and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). The accuracy of predicting 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year survival was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), calibration curves, and the area under the ROC curves (AUC).
RESULTS: A total of 3145 patients were finally enrolled in our study. The mean age at diagnosis was 52 ± 18 years, 1662 of the 3145 patients were male (53%), and mean survival time was 83 ± 67 months. Two deep learning models outperformed the RSF and classical CoxPH models, with the C-index on test datasets achieving values of 0.832 (DeepSurv) and 0.821 (NMTLR). The DeepSurv model produced better accuracy and calibrated survival estimates in predicting 1-, 3- 5- and 10-year survival (AUC:0.895-0.937). We deployed the DeepSurv model as a web application for use in clinical practice; it can be accessed through https://share.streamlit.io/whuh-ml/chondrosarcoma/Predict/app.py.
CONCLUSIONS: Time-to-event prediction models based on deep learning algorithms are successful in predicting chondrosarcoma prognosis, with DeepSurv producing the best discriminative performance and calibration.",other,Not specified

METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we developed and validated a deep learning survival model using consecutive cases of newly diagnosed stage I to IV esophageal cancer between January 2004 and December 2015 in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The model was externally validated in an independent cohort from Fujian Provincial Hospital. The C statistic was used to compare the performance of the deep learning survival model and TNM staging system. Two other deep learning risk prediction models were trained for treatment recommendations. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare survival between the population that followed the recommended therapy and those who did not.
RESULTS: A total of 9069 patients were included in this study. The deep learning network showed more promising results in predicting esophageal cancer-specific survival than the TNM stage in the internal test dataset (C-index=0.753 vs. 0.638) and external validation dataset (C-index=0.687 vs. 0.643). The population who received the recommended treatments had superior survival compared to those who did not, based on the internal test dataset (hazard ratio, 0.753; 95% CI, 0.556-0.987; P=0.042) and the external validation dataset (hazard ratio, 0.633; 95% CI, 0.459-0.834; P=0.0003).

METHODS: In this large population-based study, we developed and validated a deep learning survival neural network using pathologically diagnosed patients with LSCC from the SEER database between January 2010 and December 2018. Totally 13 variables were included in this network, including patients baseline characteristics, stage, grade, site, tumor extension and treatment details. Based on the total risk score derived from this algorithm, a three-knot restricted cubic spline was plotted to exhibit the difference of survival benefits from two treatment modalities.
RESULTS: Totally 6316 patients with LSCC were included in the study, of which 4237 cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were selected as the development cohort, and the rest (2079 cases diagnosed from 2016 to 2018) were the validation cohort. A state-of-the-art deep learning-based model based on 23 features (i.e., 13 variables) was generated, which showed more superior performance in the prediction of overall survival (OS) than the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system (C-index for DeepSurv vs TNM staging = 0.71; 95% CI 0.69-0.74 vs 0.61; 95% CI 0.60-0.63). Interestingly, a significantly nonlinear association between total risk score and treatment effectiveness was observed. When the total risk score ranges 0.1-1.5, surgical treatment brought more survival benefits than nonsurgical one for LSCC patients, especially in 70.5% of patients staged III-IV.
CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning-based model shows more potential benefits in survival estimation for patients with LSCC, which may potentially serve as an auxiliary approach to provide reliable treatment recommendations.",other,Not specified

A prediction model that combines multiple features to assess contamination risks was established in the hope of supporting healthcare workers worldwide in triaging patients, particularly in situations with limited health care resources. Furthermore, a lack of diagnosis kits and asymptomatic cases can lead to missed or delayed diagnoses, exposing visitors, medical staff, and patients to 2019-nCoV contamination. Non-clinical techniques including data mining, expert systems, machine learning, and other artificial intelligence technologies have a crucial role to play in containment and diagnosis in the COVID-19 outbreak. This study developed Enhanced Gravitational Search Optimization with a Hybrid Deep Learning Model (EGSO-HDLM) for COVID-19 diagnoses using epidemiology data. The major aim of designing the EGSO-HDLM model was the identification and classification of COVID-19 using epidemiology data. In order to examine the epidemiology data, the EGSO-HDLM model employed a hybrid convolutional neural network with a gated recurrent unit based fusion (HCNN-GRUF) model. In addition, the hyperparameter optimization of the HCNN-GRUF model was improved by the use of the EGSO algorithm, which was derived by including the concepts of cat map and the traditional GSO algorithm. The design of the EGSO algorithm helps in reducing the ergodic problem, avoiding premature convergence, and enhancing algorithm efficiency. To demonstrate the better performance of the EGSO-HDLM model, experimental validation on a benchmark dataset was performed. The simulation results ensured the enhanced performance of the EGSO-HDLM model over recent approaches.",other,Not specified

We aimed to compare the prognostic value of various machine learning techniques (MLTs) and statistical Cox regression model for different types of HNC.
METHODS: Clinical data of HNC patients were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1974 to 2016. The prediction performance of five ML models, including random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN) and deep learning (DL), were compared with the statistical Cox regression model by estimating the concordance index (C-index), integrated Brier score (IBS), time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Our results showed that the RF model outperformed all other models in prognostic prediction for all tumor sites of HNC, particularly for major salivary gland cancer (MSGC, C-index: 88.730 ± 0.8700, IBS: 7.680 ± 0.4800), oral cavity cancer (OCC, C-index: 84.250 ± 0.6700, IBS: 11.480 ± 0.3300) and oropharyngeal cancer (OPC, C-index: 82.510 ± 0.5400, IBS: 10.120 ± 0.1400). Meanwhile, we analyzed the importance of each clinical variable in the RF model, in which age and tumor size presented the strongest positive prognostic effects. Additionally, similar results can be observed in the internal (6th edition of the AJCC TNM staging system cohort) and external validations (the TCGA HNC cohort).

Unfortunately, this method faces a computational time problem. The objective of this paper is to describe the implementation of the WCE statistical model using Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) programming as a tool to obtain the spectrum of adverse drug reactions from medico-administrative databases. The process is divided into three steps: pre-processing of care pathways using the Python library Panda, calculation of temporal co-variables using the Python library ""KeOps"", estimation of the model parameters using the Python library ""PyTorch"" - standard in deep learning. Programming the WCE method by distributing the heaviest portions (notably spline calculation) on the GPU makes it possible to accelerate the time required for this method by 1000 times using a computer graphics card and up to 10,000 times with a GPU server.

Purpose To evaluate the clinical and imaging significance of increasing emphysema severity as graded by a deep learning algorithm on sequential CT scans in cigarette smokers. Materials and Methods A secondary analysis of the prospective Genetic Epidemiology of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPDGene) study participants was performed and included baseline and 5-year follow-up CT scans from 2007 to 2017. Emphysema was classified automatically according to the Fleischner emphysema grading system at baseline and 5-year follow-up using a deep learning model. Baseline and change in clinical and imaging parameters at 5-year follow-up were compared in participants whose emphysema progressed versus those who did not. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression were used to assess the relationship between emphysema score progression and mortality. Results A total of 5056 participants (mean age, 60 years ± 9 [SD]; 2566 men) were evaluated. At 5-year follow-up, 1293 of the 5056 participants (26%) had emphysema progression according to the Fleischner grading system. This group demonstrated progressive airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [percent predicted]: -3.4 vs -1.8), a greater decline in 6-minute walk distance (-177 m vs -124 m), and greater progression in quantitative emphysema extent (adjusted lung density: -1.4 g/L vs 0.5 g/L; percentage of lung voxels with CT attenuation less than -950 HU: 0.6 vs 0.2) than those with nonprogressive emphysema (P &lt; .001 for each).

A new prognostic system for stage III NSCLC was also proposed based on the established deep learning model.
RESULTS: The study included 16,613 patients with stage III NSCLC from the SEER database. DSLM showed the best performance in survival prediction, with a C-index of 0.725 in the validation set, followed by RSF (0.688) and CPH (0.683). DSLM also showed C-indices of 0.719 and 0.665 in the internal and real-world external testing datasets, respectively. In addition, the new prognostic system based on DSLM (AUROC = 0.744) showed better performance than the TNM staging system (AUROC = 0.561).
CONCLUSION: In this study, a new, integrated deep learning-based prognostic model was developed and evaluated for stage III NSCLC. This novel approach may be valuable in improving patient stratification and potentially provide meaningful prognostic information that contributes to personalized therapy.",other,Not specified

However, the underlying mechanisms are yet not fully understood. In the present study, we applied an animal model to study chronic cadmium exposure-induced renal injury and performed whole transcriptome profiling studies. Repetitive CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure resulted in cadmium accumulation and remarkable renal injuries in the animals. The diabetic ob/ob mice manifested increased severity of renal injury compared with the wild type C57BL/6 J littermate controls. RNA-Seq data showed that cadmium treatment induced dramatic gene expression changes in a dose-dependent manner. Among the differentially expressed genes include the apoptosis hallmark genes which significantly demarcated the treatment effects. Pathway enrichment and network analyses revealed biological oxidation (mainly glucuronidation) as one of the major stress responses induced by cadmium treatment. We next implemented a deep learning algorithm in conjunction with cloud computing and discovered a gene signature that can predict the degree of renal injury induced by cadmium treatment. The present study provided, for the first time, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of chronic cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity in normal and diabetic populations at the whole genome level.",transformer/generative,Not specified

It is, however, a complex task usually requiring human expert intervention, thus making it expansive and time-consuming. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, have enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems, with the notable example of neural sequence models and their powerful applications in natural language processing. However, they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. The Centre for Epidemiology on Medical Causes of Death (CépiDc) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of natural language examples provided with their associated human-coded medical entities available to the machine learning practitioner.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to investigate the application of deep neural sequence models to the problem of medical entity recognition from natural language.
METHODS: The investigated data set included every French death certificate from 2011 to 2016. These certificates contain information such as the subject's age, the subject's gender, and the chain of events leading to his or her death, both in French and encoded as International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) medical entities, for a total of around 3 million observations in the data set. The task of automatically recognizing ICD-10 medical entities from the French natural language-based chain of events leading to death was then formulated as a type of predictive modeling problem known as a sequence-to-sequence modeling problem. A deep neural network-based model, known as the Transformer, was then slightly adapted and fit to the data set. Its performance was then assessed on an external data set and compared to the current state-of-the-art approach. CIs for derived measurements were estimated via bootstrapping.
RESULTS: The proposed approach resulted in an F-measure value of 0.952 (95% CI 0.946-0.957), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art approach and its previously reported F-measure value of 0.825 as assessed on a comparable data set. Such an improvement makes possible a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level automated coding to temporal harmonization of death statistics.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows that a deep artificial neural network can directly learn from voluminous data sets in order to identify complex relationships between natural language and medical entities, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived model constitutes a powerful tool for automated coding of medical entities from medical language with promising potential applications.",text mining,Not specified

DESIGN: Evaluation of a diagnostic test or technology.
SUBJECTS AND CONTROLS: We included 5245 patients with wide-angle retinal imaging from the neonatal intensive care units of 7 institutions as part of the Imaging and Informatics in ROP study. Images were labeled with the clinical diagnoses of plus disease (plus, preplus, no plus), which were documented in the chart, and a reference standard diagnosis was determined by 3 image-based ROP graders and the clinical diagnosis.
METHODS: Demographics (birth weight, gestational age) and clinical diagnoses for all eye examinations were recorded from each institution. Using an FL approach, a DL model for plus disease classification was trained using only the clinical labels. The 3 class probabilities were then converted into a vascular severity score (VSS) for each eye examination, as well as an ""institutional VSS,"" in which the average of the VSS values assigned to patients' higher severity (""worse"") eyes at each examination was calculated for each institution.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared demographics, clinical diagnoses of plus disease, and institutional VSSs between institutions using the McNemar-Bowker test, 2-proportion Z test, and 1-way analysis of variance with post hoc analysis by the Tukey-Kramer test. Single regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between demographics and VSSs.
RESULTS: We found that the proportion of patients diagnosed with preplus disease varied significantly between institutions (P &lt; 0.001). Using the DL-derived VSS trained on the data from all institutions using FL, we observed differences in the institutional VSS and the level of vascular severity diagnosed as no plus (P &lt; 0.001) across institutions. A significant, inverse relationship between the institutional VSS and mean gestational age was found (P = 0.049, adjusted R2 = 0.49).
CONCLUSIONS: A DL-derived ROP VSS developed without sharing data between institutions using FL identified differences in the clinical diagnoses of plus disease and overall levels of ROP severity between institutions. Federated learning may represent a method to standardize clinical diagnoses and provide objective measurements of disease for image-based diseases.",other,Not specified

Now, transforming these huge volumes of data into knowledge is the primary challenge in computational biology. The traditional methods of data analysis have failed to carry out the task. Hence, researchers are turning to machine learning based approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional big data. In machine learning, once a model is trained with a training dataset, it can be applied on a testing dataset which is independent. In current times, deep learning algorithms further promote the application of machine learning in several field of biology including plant virology.
MAIN BODY: Plant viruses have emerged as one of the principal global threats to food security due to their devastating impact on crops and vegetables. The emergence of new viral strains and species help viruses to evade the concurrent preventive methods. According to a survey conducted in 2014, plant viruses are anticipated to cause a global yield loss of more than thirty billion USD per year. In order to design effective, durable and broad-spectrum management protocols, it is very important to understand the mechanistic details of viral pathogenesis. The application of machine learning enables precise diagnosis of plant viral diseases at an early stage. Furthermore, the development of several machine learning-guided bioinformatics platforms has primed plant virologists to understand the host-virus interplay better. In addition, machine learning has tremendous potential in deciphering the pattern of plant virus evolution and emergence as well as in developing viable control options.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering a significant progress in the application of machine learning in understanding plant virology, this review highlights an introductory note on machine learning and comprehensively discusses the trends and prospects of machine learning in the diagnosis of viral diseases, understanding host-virus interplay and emergence of plant viruses.",other,Not specified

We used this information to establish a model that combined deep learning with a multilayer neural network (the DeepSurv model) for predicting the survival rate of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: We collected patients with rectal adenocarcinoma in the United States and older than 20 yearswho had been added to the SEER database from 2004 to 2015. We divided these patients into training and test cohortsat a ratio of 7:3. The training cohort was used to develop a seven-layer neural network based on the analysis method established by Katzman and colleagues to construct a DeepSurv prediction model. We then used the C-index and calibration plots to evaluate the prediction performance of the DeepSurv model.
RESULTS: The 49,275 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma included in the study were randomly divided into the training cohort (70%, n = 34,492) and the test cohort (30%, n = 14,783). There were no statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two cohorts (p > 0.05). We applied Cox proportional-hazards regression to the data in the training cohort, which showed that age, sex, marital status, tumor grade, surgery status, and chemotherapy status were significant factors influencing survival (p < 0.05). Using the training cohort to construct the DeepSurv model resulted in a C-index of the model of 0.824, while using the test cohort to verify the DeepSurv model yielded a C-index of 0.821. Thesevalues show that the prediction effect of the DeepSurv model for the test-cohort patients was highly consistent with the prediction resultsfor the training-cohort patients.
CONCLUSION: The DeepSurv prediction model of the seven-layer neural network that we have established can accurately predict the survival rateand time of rectal adenocarcinoma patients.",other,Not specified

Apart from its distinct epidemiology, the natural behavior, treatment, and prognosis are different from other head and neck cancers. With the growing trend of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL), in head and neck cancer care, we sought to explore the unique clinical application and implementation direction of AI in the management of NPC.
METHODS: The search protocol was performed to collect publications using AI, machine learning (ML) and DL in NPC management from PubMed, Scopus and Embase. The articles were filtered using inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the quality of the papers was assessed. Data were extracted from the finalized articles.
RESULTS: A total of 78 articles were reviewed after removing duplicates and papers that did not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After quality assessment, 60 papers were included in the current study. There were four main types of applications, which were auto-contouring, diagnosis, prognosis, and miscellaneous applications (especially on radiotherapy planning). The different forms of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) accounted for the majority of DL algorithms used, while the artificial neural network (ANN) was the most frequent ML model implemented.
CONCLUSION: There is an overall positive impact identified from AI implementation in the management of NPC. With improving AI algorithms, we envisage AI will be available as a routine application in a clinical setting soon.",other,Not specified

Machine learning methodologies such as deep neural networks provide a potential avenue for increasing accuracy in GFR estimation. We developed a novel deep learning architecture, a deep and shallow neural network, to estimate GFR (dlGFR for short) and examined its comparative performance with estimated GFR from Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. The dlGFR model jointly trains a shallow learning model and a deep neural network to enable both linear transformation from input features to a log GFR target, and non-linear feature embedding for stage of kidney function classification. We validate the proposed methods on the data from multiple studies obtained from the NIDDK Central Database Repository. The deep learning model predicted values of GFR within 30% of measured GFR with 88.3% accuracy, compared to the 87.1% and 84.7% of the accuracy achieved by CKD-EPI and MDRD equations (p = 0.051 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Our results suggest that deep learning methods are superior to equations resulting from traditional statistical methods in estimating glomerular filtration rate. Based on these results, an end-to-end predication system has been deployed to facilitate use of the proposed dlGFR algorithm.",other,Not specified

Efficient release of enveloped virions, which promote systemic spread of infection within hosts, requires the VACV protein E2 but the molecular basis of E2 function remains unclear and E2 lacks sequence homology to any well-characterised family of proteins. We solved the crystal structure of VACV E2 to 2.3 Å resolution, revealing that it comprises two domains with novel folds: an N-terminal annular (ring) domain and a C-terminal globular (head) domain. The C-terminal head domain displays weak structural homology with cellular (pseudo)kinases but lacks conserved surface residues or kinase features, suggesting that it is not enzymatically active, and possesses a large surface basic patch that might interact with phosphoinositide lipid headgroups. Recent deep learning methods have revolutionised our ability to predict the three-dimensional structures of proteins from primary sequence alone. VACV E2 is an exemplar 'difficult' viral protein target for structure prediction, being comprised of multiple novel domains and lacking sequence homologues outside Poxviridae. AlphaFold2 nonetheless succeeds in predicting the structures of the head and ring domains with high and moderate accuracy, respectively, allowing accurate inference of multiple structural properties. The advent of highly accurate virus structure prediction marks a step-change in structural virology and beckons a new era of structurally-informed molecular virology.",other,Not specified

We then leverage this insight to design algorithms to perform CA at scale. Specifically, we demonstrate how the principal inertia components can be reliably approximated from data using deep neural networks.

However, it remains unclear whether AI provides meaningful and generalizable improvement in predictive accuracy beyond clinical risk factors for AF.
METHODS: We trained a convolutional neural network (ECG-AI) to infer 5-year incident AF risk using 12-lead ECGs in patients receiving longitudinal primary care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). We then fit 3 Cox proportional hazards models, composed of ECG-AI 5-year AF probability, CHARGE-AF clinical risk score (Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology-Atrial Fibrillation), and terms for both ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF (CH-AI), respectively. We assessed model performance by calculating discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration in an internal test set and 2 external test sets (Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH] and UK Biobank). Models were recalibrated to estimate 2-year AF risk in the UK Biobank given limited available follow-up. We used saliency mapping to identify ECG features most influential on ECG-AI risk predictions and assessed correlation between ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF linear predictors.
RESULTS: The training set comprised 45 770 individuals (age 55±17 years, 53% women, 2171 AF events) and the test sets comprised 83 162 individuals (age 59±13 years, 56% women, 2424 AF events). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was comparable using CHARGE-AF (MGH, 0.802 [95% CI, 0.767-0.836]; BWH, 0.752 [95% CI, 0.741-0.763]; UK Biobank, 0.732 [95% CI, 0.704-0.759]) and ECG-AI (MGH, 0.823 [95% CI, 0.790-0.856]; BWH, 0.747 [95% CI, 0.736-0.759]; UK Biobank, 0.705 [95% CI, 0.673-0.737]). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest using CH-AI (MGH, 0.838 [95% CI, 0.807 to 0.869]; BWH, 0.777 [95% CI, 0.766 to 0.788]; UK Biobank, 0.746 [95% CI, 0.716 to 0.776]). Calibration error was low using ECG-AI (MGH, 0.0212; BWH, 0.0129; UK Biobank, 0.0035) and CH-AI (MGH, 0.012; BWH, 0.0108; UK Biobank, 0.0001). In saliency analyses, the ECG P-wave had the greatest influence on AI model predictions. ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF linear predictors were correlated (Pearson r: MGH, 0.61; BWH, 0.66; UK Biobank, 0.41).
CONCLUSIONS: AI-based analysis of 12-lead ECGs has similar predictive usefulness to a clinical risk factor model for incident AF and the approaches are complementary. ECG-AI may enable efficient quantification of future AF risk.",other,Not specified

As the tipping point is approached, the dynamics of complex and varied systems simplify down to a limited number of possible ""normal forms"" that determine qualitative aspects of the new state that lies beyond the tipping point, such as whether it will oscillate or be stable. In several of those forms, indicators like increasing lag-1 autocorrelation and variance provide generic early warning signals (EWS) of the tipping point by detecting how dynamics slow down near the transition. But they do not predict the nature of the new state. Here we develop a deep learning algorithm that provides EWS in systems it was not explicitly trained on, by exploiting information about normal forms and scaling behavior of dynamics near tipping points that are common to many dynamical systems. The algorithm provides EWS in 268 empirical and model time series from ecology, thermoacoustics, climatology, and epidemiology with much greater sensitivity and specificity than generic EWS. It can also predict the normal form that characterizes the oncoming tipping point, thus providing qualitative information on certain aspects of the new state.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading globally, affecting millions of people worldwide, and led to significant loss of lives and deterioration of the global economy. The current adverse effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic demands finding new detection methods for future viral outbreaks. The environment's transmission pathways include and are not limited to air, surface water, and wastewater environments. The wastewater surveillance, known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), can potentially monitor viral outbreaks and provide a complementary clinical testing method. Another investigated outbreak surveillance technique that has not been yet implemented in a sufficient number of studies is the surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the air. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its related machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies are currently emerging techniques for detecting viral outbreaks using global data. To date, there are no reports that illustrate the potential of using WBE with AI to detect viral outbreaks. This study investigates the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment and provides current updates on the surveillance of viral outbreaks using WBE, viral air sampling, and AI. It also proposes a novel framework based on an ensemble of ML and DL algorithms to provide a beneficial supportive tool for decision-makers. The framework exploits available data from reliable sources to discover meaningful insights and knowledge that allows researchers and practitioners to build efficient methods and protocols that accurately monitor and detect viral outbreaks. The proposed framework could provide early detection of viruses, forecast risk maps and vulnerable areas, and estimate the number of infected citizens.",other,Not specified

METHODS: PubMed search of 2020 literature on public health and epidemiology informatics was conducted and all retrieved references were reviewed by the two section editors. Then, 15 candidate best papers were selected among the 920 references. These papers were then peer-reviewed by the two section editors, two chief editors, and external reviewers, including at least two senior faculty, to allow the Editorial Committee of the 2021 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook to make an informed decision regarding the selection of the best papers.
RESULTS: Among the 920 references retrieved from PubMed, four were suggested as best papers and the first three were finally selected. The fourth paper was excluded because of reproducibility issues. The first best paper is a very public health focused paper with health informatics and biostatistics methods applied to stratify patients within a cohort in order to identify those at risk of suicide; the second paper describes the use of a randomized design to test the likely impact of fear-based messages, with and without empowering self-management elements, on patient consultations or antibiotic requests for influenza-like illnesses. The third selected paper evaluates the perception among communities of routine use of Whole Genome Sequencing and Big Data technologies to capture more detailed and specific personal information.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the three studies suggest that using Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics methods could leverage, when combined with Deep Learning, early interventions and appropriate treatments to mitigate suicide risk. Further, they also demonstrate that well informing and empowering patients could help them to be involved more in their care process.",other,Not specified

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to perform an analysis of the expressed emotions in English tweets by Greek Twitter users during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece.
METHODS: The period of this study was from January 25, 2020 to June 30, 2020. Data collection was performed by using appropriate search words with the filter-streaming application programming interface of Twitter. The emotional analysis of the tweets that satisfied the inclusion criteria was achieved using a deep learning approach that performs better by utilizing recurrent neural networks on sequences of characters. Emotional epidemiology tools such as the 6 basic emotions, that is, joy, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger based on the Paul Ekman classification were adopted.
RESULTS: The most frequent emotion that was detected in the tweets was ""surprise"" at the emerging contagion, while the imposed isolation resulted mostly in ""anger"" (odds ratio 2.108, 95% CI 0.986-4.506). Although the Greeks felt rather safe during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, their positive and negative emotions reflected a masked ""flight or fight"" or ""fear versus anger"" response to the contagion.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study show that emotional analysis emerges as a valid tool for epidemiology evaluations, design, and public health strategy and surveillance.",other,Not specified

The retina possesses features that can be affected by gender differences, and the extent to which these features are captured via photography differs depending on the retinal image field.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare deep learning algorithms' performance in predicting gender based on different fields of fundus photographs (optic disc-centered, macula-centered, and peripheral fields).
METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included 172,170 fundus photographs of 9956 adults aged ≥40 years from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study. Optic disc-centered, macula-centered, and peripheral field fundus images were included in this study as input data for a deep learning model for gender prediction. Performance was estimated at the individual level and image level. Receiver operating characteristic curves for binary classification were calculated.
RESULTS: The deep learning algorithms predicted gender with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94 at the individual level and an AUC of 0.87 at the image level. Across the three image field types, the best performance was seen when using optic disc-centered field images (younger subgroups: AUC=0.91; older subgroups: AUC=0.86), and algorithms that used peripheral field images had the lowest performance (younger subgroups: AUC=0.85; older subgroups: AUC=0.76). Across the three ethnic subgroups, algorithm performance was lowest in the Indian subgroup (AUC=0.88) compared to that in the Malay (AUC=0.91) and Chinese (AUC=0.91) subgroups when the algorithms were tested on optic disc-centered images. Algorithms' performance in gender prediction at the image level was better in younger subgroups (aged <65 years; AUC=0.89) than in older subgroups (aged ≥65 years; AUC=0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that gender among the Asian population can be predicted with fundus photographs by using deep learning, and our algorithms' performance in terms of gender prediction differed according to the field of fundus photographs, age subgroups, and ethnic groups. Our work provides a further understanding of using deep learning models for the prediction of gender-related diseases. Further validation of our findings is still needed.",other,Not specified

Epub 2021 Jul 29.,Matuszewski DJ,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2021,2021/08/10,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106318,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To achieve the full potential of deep learning (DL) models, such as understanding the interplay between model (size), training strategy, and amount of training data, researchers and developers need access to new dedicated image datasets; i.e., annotated collections of images representing real-world problems with all their variations, complexity, limitations, and noise. Here, we present, describe and make freely available an annotated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image dataset. It constitutes an interesting challenge for many practical applications in virology and epidemiology; e.g., virus detection, segmentation, classification, and novelty detection. We also present benchmarking results for virus detection and recognition using some of the top-performing (large and small) networks as well as a handcrafted very small network. We compare and evaluate transfer learning and training from scratch hypothesizing that with a limited dataset, transfer learning is crucial for good performance of a large network whereas our handcrafted small network performs relatively well when training from scratch. This is one step towards understanding how much training data is needed for a given task.
METHODS: The benchmark dataset contains 1245 images of 22 virus classes. We propose a representative data split into training, validation, and test sets for this dataset. Moreover, we compare different established DL networks and present a baseline DL solution for classifying a subset of the 14 most-represented virus classes in the dataset.
RESULTS: Our best model, DenseNet201 pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the training set, achieved a 0.921 F1-score and 93.1% accuracy on the proposed representative test set.
CONCLUSIONS: Public and real biomedical datasets are an important contribution and a necessity to increase the understanding of shortcomings, requirements, and potential improvements for deep learning solutions on biomedical problems or deploying solutions in clinical settings. We compared transfer learning to learning from scratch on this dataset and hypothesize that for limited-sized datasets transfer learning is crucial for achieving good performance for large models.

First, we attempted to understand the association between the COVID-19 transmission rate, environmental factors (air pollution, weather, mobility), and socio-political parameters (Government Stringency Index, GSI). Second, we evaluated the efficiency of various strategies, including radical opening, intermittent lockdown, phase lift, and contact tracing, to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and get back to pre-pandemic conditions using a stochastic individual-based epidemiology model. Third, we used a deep learning approach and simulated the vaccination rate and the time for reaching herd immunity. The analysis was done based on the collected data from eight countries in Asia, including Iran, Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, South Korea, and Russia (as a transcontinental country). Our findings in the first part highlighted a noninfluential impact from the weather-driven parameters and short-term exposure to pollutants on the transmission rate; however, long-term exposure could potentially increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality rates (based on 1998-2017 p.m.2.5 data). Mobility was highly correlated with the COVID-19 transmission and based on our causal analysis reducing mobility could curb the COVID-19 transmission rate with a 6-day lag time (on average). Secondly, among all the tested policies for exiting the COVID-19 pandemic, the contact tracing was the most efficient if executed correctly. With a 2-day delay in tracing the virus hosts, a 60% successful host tracing, and a 70% contact reduction with the hosts, a pandemic will end in a year without overburdening a healthcare system with 6000 hospital beds capacity per million. Lastly, our vaccine simulations showed that the target date for achieving herd immunity significantly varied among the countries and could be delayed to October-november 2022 in countries like India and Iran (based on 60% immunized population and assuming no intermediate factors affecting the vaccination rate).",other,Not specified

METHODS: Referable pterygium was defined as having extension towards the cornea from the limbus of >2.50 mm or base width at the limbus of >5.00 mm. 2503 images from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study were used as the development set. Algorithms were validated on an internal set from the SEED cohort (629 images (55.3% pterygium, 8.4% referable pterygium)), and tested on two external clinic-based sets (set 1 with 2610 images (2.8% pterygium, 0.7% referable pterygium, from slit-lamp ASP); and set 2 with 3701 images, 2.5% pterygium, 0.9% referable pterygium, from hand-held ASP).
RESULTS: The algorithm's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for detection of any pterygium was 99.5%(sensitivity=98.6%; specificity=99.0%) in internal test set, 99.1% (sensitivity=95.9%, specificity=98.5%) in external test set 1 and 99.7% (sensitivity=100.0%; specificity=88.3%) in external test set 2.

Automating the WHO methodology may support more widespread application of this endpoint.
METHODS: We trained a deep learning model to classify pneumonia CXRs in children using the World Health Organization (WHO)'s standardized methodology. The model was pretrained on CheXpert, a dataset containing 224,316 adult CXRs, and fine-tuned on PERCH, a pediatric dataset containing 4,172 CXRs. The model was then tested on two pediatric CXR datasets released by WHO. We also compared the model's performance to that of radiologists and pediatricians.
RESULTS: The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for primary endpoint pneumonia (PEP) across 10-fold validation of PERCH images was 0.928; average AUC after testing on WHO images was 0.977. The model's classification performance was better on test images with high inter-observer agreement; however, the model still outperformed human assessments in AUC and precision-recall spaces on low agreement images.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, an algorithm using co-registration and lung segmentation was developed in-house to automate quantification of emphysema and air trapping from inspiratory and expiratory CT images. The algorithm was then tested in a separate group of 8951 patients from the COPD Genetic Epidemiology study (date range, 2007-2017). With measurements of emphysema and air trapping, bivariable thresholds were determined to define CT stages of severity (mild, moderate, severe, and very severe) and were evaluated for their ability to prognosticate disease progression and mortality using logistic regression and Cox regression.
RESULTS: On the basis of CT stages, the odds of disease progression were greatest among patients with very severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% CI: 2.02, 3.53; P &lt; .001) and were elevated in patients with moderate disease (OR, 1.50; 95% CI: 1.22, 1.84; P = .001). The hazard ratio of mortality for very severe disease at CT was 2.23 times the normal ratio (95% CI: 1.93, 2.58; P &lt; .001). When combined with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) staging, patients with GOLD stage 2 disease had the greatest odds of disease progression when the CT stage was severe (OR, 4.48; 95% CI: 3.18, 6.31; P &lt; .001) or very severe (OR, 4.72; 95% CI: 3.13, 7.13; P &lt; .001).

The emergence of deep learning technology offers new opportunities to revolutionise this clinical referral pathway. We aimed to assess the performance of a newly developed deep learning algorithm for detection of disease-related visual impairment.
METHODS: In this proof-of-concept study, using retinal fundus images from 15 175 eyes with complete data related to best-corrected visual acuity or pinhole visual acuity from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study, we first developed a single-modality deep learning algorithm based on retinal photographs alone for detection of any disease-related visual impairment (defined as eyes from patients with major eye diseases and best-corrected visual acuity of <20/40), and moderate or worse disease-related visual impairment (eyes with disease and best-corrected visual acuity of <20/60). After development of the algorithm, we tested it internally, using a new set of 3803 eyes from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study. We then tested it externally using three population-based studies (the Beijing Eye study [6239 eyes], Central India Eye and Medical study [6526 eyes], and Blue Mountains Eye Study [2002 eyes]), and two clinical studies (the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Sight Threatening Diabetic Retinopathy study [971 eyes] and the Outram Polyclinic Study [1225 eyes]). The algorithm's performance in each dataset was assessed on the basis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
FINDINGS: In the internal test dataset, the AUC for detection of any disease-related visual impairment was 94·2% (95% CI 93·0-95·3; sensitivity 90·7% [87·0-93·6]; specificity 86·8% [85·6-87·9]). The AUC for moderate or worse disease-related visual impairment was 93·9% (95% CI 92·2-95·6; sensitivity 94·6% [89·6-97·6]; specificity 81·3% [80·0-82·5]). Across the five external test datasets (16 993 eyes), the algorithm achieved AUCs ranging between 86·6% (83·4-89·7; sensitivity 87·5% [80·7-92·5]; specificity 70·0% [66·7-73·1]) and 93·6% (92·4-94·8; sensitivity 87·8% [84·1-90·9]; specificity 87·1% [86·2-88·0]) for any disease-related visual impairment, and the AUCs for moderate or worse disease-related visual impairment ranged between 85·9% (81·8-90·1; sensitivity 84·7% [73·0-92·8]; specificity 74·4% [71·4-77·2]) and 93·5% (91·7-95·3; sensitivity 90·3% [84·2-94·6]; specificity 84·2% [83·2-85·1]).
INTERPRETATION: This proof-of-concept study shows the potential of a single-modality, function-focused tool in identifying visual impairment related to major eye diseases, providing more timely and pinpointed referral of patients with disease-related visual impairment from the community to tertiary eye hospitals.

METHODS: A total of 797 uterine adenosarcoma patients were enrolled in this study. Duplicated and useless variables were excluded, and 15 variables were selected for further analyses, including age, grade, positive lymph nodes or not, marital status, race, tumor extension, stage, and surgery or not. We created our deep survival learning (DSL) model to manipulate the data, which was randomly split into a training set (n = 519, 65%), validation set (n = 143, 18%) and testing set (n = 143, 18%). The Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model was also included comparatively. Finally, personalized survival curves were plotted for randomly selected patients.
RESULTS: The c-index for the CPH model was 0.726, and the Brier score was 0.17. For our deep survival learning model, we achieved a c-index of 0.774 and a Brier score of 0.14 in the external testing set.

We evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening in an Indian ROP telemedicine program and whether differences in ROP severity between neonatal care units (NCUs) identified by using AI are related to differences in oxygen-titrating capability.
METHODS: External validation study of an existing AI-based quantitative severity scale for ROP on a data set of images from the Retinopathy of Prematurity Eradication Save Our Sight ROP telemedicine program in India. All images were assigned an ROP severity score (1-9) by using the Imaging and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity Deep Learning system. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity and specificity for treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity. Using multivariable linear regression, we evaluated the mean and median ROP severity in each NCU as a function of mean birth weight, gestational age, and the presence of oxygen blenders and pulse oxygenation monitors.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity was 0.98, with 100% sensitivity and 78% specificity. We found higher median (interquartile range) ROP severity in NCUs without oxygen blenders and pulse oxygenation monitors, most apparent in bigger infants (&gt;1500 g and 31 weeks' gestation: 2.7 [2.5-3.0] vs 3.1 [2.4-3.8]; P = .007, with adjustment for birth weight and gestational age).
CONCLUSIONS: Integration of AI into ROP screening programs may lead to improved access to care for secondary prevention of ROP and may facilitate assessment of disease epidemiology and NCU resources.",other,Not specified

In this work, we focus on a fundamental problem that enables social media mining for disease monitoring. We present and make available SEED, a natural language processing approach to detect symptom and disease mentions from social media data obtained from platforms such as Twitter and DailyStrength and to normalize them into UMLS terminology. Using multi-corpus training and deep learning models, the tool achieves an overall F1 score of 0.86 and 0.72 on DailyStrength and balanced Twitter datasets, significantly improving over previous approaches on the same datasets. We apply the tool on Twitter posts that report COVID19 symptoms, particularly to quantify whether the SEED system can extract symptoms absent in the training data. The study results also draw attention to the potential of multi-corpus training for performance improvements and the need for continuous training on newly obtained data for consistent performance amidst the ever-changing nature of the social media vocabulary.",text mining,Not specified

It is a challenging task because of the poor distinguishability of features and the missing values in practice. A novel multi-task based neural network, SurvNet, is proposed in this paper. The proposed SurvNet model is trained in a multi-task learning framework to jointly learn across three related tasks: input reconstruction, survival classification, and Cox regression. It uses an input reconstruction mechanism cooperating with incomplete-aware reconstruction loss for latent feature learning of incomplete data with missing values. Besides, the SurvNet model introduces a context gating mechanism to bridge the gap between survival classification and Cox regression. A new real-world dataset of 1,137 patients with IB-IIA stage non-small cell lung cancer is collected to evaluate the performance of the SurvNet model. The proposed SurvNet achieves a higher concordance index than the traditional Cox model and Cox-Net. The difference between high-risk and low-risk groups obtained by SurvNet is more significant than that of high-risk and low-risk groups obtained by the other models. Moreover, the SurvNet outperforms the other models even though the input data is randomly cropped and it achieves better generalization performance on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) dataset.",other,Not specified

In recent decades, there has been an expansion of AI applications in biomedical sciences. The possibilities of artificial intelligence in the field of medical diagnostics, risk prediction and support of therapeutic techniques are growing rapidly. The aim of the article is to analyze the current use of AI in nutrients science research. The literature review was conducted in PubMed. A total of 399 records published between 1987 and 2020 were obtained, of which, after analyzing the titles and abstracts, 261 were rejected. In the next stages, the remaining records were analyzed using the full-text versions and, finally, 55 papers were selected. These papers were divided into three areas: AI in biomedical nutrients research (20 studies), AI in clinical nutrients research (22 studies) and AI in nutritional epidemiology (13 studies). It was found that the artificial neural network (ANN) methodology was dominant in the group of research on food composition study and production of nutrients. However, machine learning (ML) algorithms were widely used in studies on the influence of nutrients on the functioning of the human body in health and disease and in studies on the gut microbiota. Deep learning (DL) algorithms prevailed in a group of research works on clinical nutrients intake. The development of dietary systems using AI technology may lead to the creation of a global network that will be able to both actively support and monitor the personalized supply of nutrients.",other,Not specified

It allows both patients and caregivers to plan resources, time and intensity of care to provide the best possible treatment path for the patients. In this paper, by focusing on lung cancer patients, we build several survival prediction models using deep learning techniques to tackle both cancer survival classification and regression problems. We also conduct feature importance analysis to understand how lung cancer patients' relevant factors impact their survival periods. We contribute to identifying an approach to estimate survivability that are commonly and practically appropriate for medical use.
METHODOLOGIES: We have compared the performance across three of the most popular deep learning architectures - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) while comparing the performing of deep learning models against traditional machine learning models. The data was obtained from the lung cancer section of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry.
RESULTS: The deep learning models outperformed traditional machine learning models across both classification and regression approaches. We obtained a best of 71.18 % accuracy for the classification approach when patients' survival periods are segmented into classes of '&lt;=6 months',' 0.5 - 2 years' and '&gt;2 years' and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 13.5 % andR2 value of 0.5 for the regression approach for the deep learning models while the traditional machine learning models saturated at 61.12 % classification accuracy and 14.87 % RMSE in regression.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach can be a baseline for early prediction with predictions that can be further improved with more temporal treatment information collected from treated patients. In addition, we evaluated the feature importance to investigate the model interpretability, gaining further insight into the survival analysis models and the factors that are important in cancer survival period prediction.",other,Not specified

Novel technologies that can quantify sleep quality at scale are required to enable the diagnosis and epidemiology of poor sleep. One important indicator of sleep quality is body posture. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a non-contact sleep monitoring system that analyses body posture and movement. Supervised machine learning strategies applied to noncontact vision-based infrared camera data using a transfer learning approach, successfully quantified sleep poses of participants covered by a blanket. This represents the first occasion that such a machine learning approach has been used to successfully detect four predefined poses and the empty bed state during 8-10 hour overnight sleep episodes representing a realistic domestic sleep situation. The methodology was evaluated against manually scored sleep poses and poses estimated using clinical polysomnography measurement technology. In a cohort of 12 healthy participants, we find that a ResNet-152 pre-trained network achieved the best performance compared with the standard de novo CNN network and other pre-trained networks. The performance of our approach was better than other video-based methods for sleep pose estimation and produced higher performance compared to the clinical standard for pose estimation using a polysomnography position sensor. It can be concluded that infrared video capture coupled with deep learning AI can be successfully used to quantify sleep poses as well as the transitions between poses in realistic nocturnal conditions, and that this non-contact approach provides superior pose estimation compared to currently accepted clinical methods.",other,Not specified

We developed an artificial intelligence deep learning algorithm (DLA) to detect chronic kidney disease from retinal images, which could add to existing chronic kidney disease screening strategies.
METHODS: We used data from three population-based, multiethnic, cross-sectional studies in Singapore and China. The Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study (SEED, patients aged ≥40 years) was used to develop (5188 patients) and validate (1297 patients) the DLA. External testing was done on two independent datasets: the Singapore Prospective Study Program (SP2, 3735 patients aged ≥25 years) and the Beijing Eye Study (BES, 1538 patients aged ≥40 years). Chronic kidney disease was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min per 1·73m2. Three models were trained: 1) image DLA; 2) risk factors (RF) including age, sex, ethnicity, diabetes, and hypertension; and 3) hybrid DLA combining image and RF. Model performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
FINDINGS: In the SEED validation dataset, the AUC was 0·911 for image DLA (95% CI 0·886 -0·936), 0·916 for RF (0·891-0·941), and 0·938 for hybrid DLA (0·917-0·959). Corresponding estimates in the SP2 testing dataset were 0·733 for image DLA (95% CI 0·696-0·770), 0·829 for RF (0·797-0·861), and 0·810 for hybrid DLA (0·776-0·844); and in the BES testing dataset estimates were 0·835 for image DLA (0·767-0·903), 0·887 for RF (0·828-0·946), and 0·858 for hybrid DLA (0·794-0·922). AUC estimates were similar in subgroups of people with diabetes (image DLA 0·889 [95% CI 0·850-0·928], RF 0·899 [0·862-0·936], hybrid 0·925 [0·893-0·957]) and hypertension (image DLA 0·889 [95% CI 0·860-0·918], RF 0·889 [0·860-0·918], hybrid 0·918 [0·893-0·943]).
INTERPRETATION: A retinal image DLA shows good performance for estimating chronic kidney disease, underlying the feasibility of using retinal photography as an adjunctive or opportunistic screening tool for chronic kidney disease in community populations.

Current approaches to prognostication rely upon conventional statistical methods such as Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models and have suboptimal predictive ability. Given the success of deep learning approaches in other specialties, we sought to develop and compare deep learning models with CPH models for the prediction of 5-year survival in pediatric GU-RMS patients.
METHODS: Patients less than 20 years of age with GU-RMS were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1998-2011). Deep neural networks (DNN) were trained and tested on an 80/20 split of the dataset in a 5-fold cross-validated fashion. Multivariable CPH models were developed in parallel. The primary outcomes were 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Variables used for prediction were age, sex, race, primary site, histology, degree of tumor extension, tumor size, receipt of surgery, and receipt of radiation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted, and DNN models were tested for calibration.
RESULTS: 277 patients were included. The area under the curve (AUC) for the DNN models was 0.93 for OS and 0.91 for DSS. AUC for the CPH models was 0.82 for OS and 0.84 for DSS. The DNN models were well-calibrated: OS model (slope = 1.02, intercept = -0.06) and DSS model (slope = 0.79, intercept = 0.21).
CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning-based model demonstrated excellent performance, superior to that of CPH models, in the prediction of pediatric GU-RMS survival. Deep learning approaches may enable improved prognostication for patients with rare cancers.",other,Not specified

Given its novelty and emergence in fields outside of biomedical research, machine learning terminology, techniques, and research findings may be unfamiliar to diabetes researchers. Our aim was to present the use of machine learning approaches in an approachable way, drawing from clinical epidemiological research in diabetes published from 1 Jan 2017 to 1 June 2020.
RECENT FINDINGS: Machine learning approaches using tree-based learners-which produce decision trees to help guide clinical interventions-frequently have higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional regression models for risk prediction. Machine learning approaches using neural networking and ""deep learning"" can be applied to medical image data, particularly for the identification and staging of diabetic retinopathy and skin ulcers. Among the machine learning approaches reviewed, researchers identified new strategies to develop standard datasets for rigorous comparisons across older and newer approaches, methods to illustrate how a machine learner was treating underlying data, and approaches to improve the transparency of the machine learning process. Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications. Achieving this potential would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons. More work remains in the application of strategies to communicate how the machine learners are generating their predictions.",other,Not specified

Deep learning is one of the advanced machine learning techniques to mitigate these types of problems. Due the presence of more number of hidden layers, it can easily handle the big amount of data. We have presented a method of classification to understand the convergence of training deep neural network (DNN). The assumptions are taken as the inputs do not degenerate and the network is over-parameterized. Also the number of hidden neurons is sufficiently large.

To advance the use of social media data as a complementary resource for epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we present a data set of 6487 tweets that mention miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth or premature labor, low birthweight, neonatal intensive care, or fetal/infant loss in general. These tweets are a subset of 22,912 tweets retrieved by applying hand-written regular expressions to a database containing more than 400 million public tweets posted by more than 100,000 women who have announced their pregnancy on Twitter [7]. Two professional annotators labeled the 6487 tweets in a binary fashion, distinguishing those potentially reporting that the user has personally experienced the outcome (""outcome"" tweets) from those that merely mention the outcome (""non-outcome"" tweets). Inter-annotator agreement was κ = 0.90 (Cohen's kappa).

OBJECTIVES: To compare the performances of DeepSurv, a deep learning survival neural network with a tumor, node, and metastasis staging system in the prediction of survival and test the reliability of individual treatment recommendations provided by the deep learning survival neural network.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this population-based cohort study, a deep learning-based algorithm was developed and validated using consecutive cases of newly diagnosed stages I to IV NSCLC between January 2010 and December 2015 in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. A total of 127 features, including patient characteristics, tumor stage, and treatment strategies, were assessed for analysis. The algorithm was externally validated on an independent test cohort, comprising 1182 patients with stage I to III NSCLC diagnosed between January 2009 and December 2013 in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. Analysis began January 2018 and ended June 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The deep learning survival neural network model was compared with the tumor, node, and metastasis staging system for lung cancer-specific survival. The C statistic was used to assess the performance of models. A user-friendly interface was provided to facilitate the survival predictions and treatment recommendations of the deep learning survival neural network model.
RESULTS: Of 17 322 patients with NSCLC included in the study, 13 361 (77.1%) were white and the median (interquartile range) age was 68 (61-74) years. The majority of tumors were stage I disease (10 273 [59.3%]) and adenocarcinoma (11 985 [69.2%]). The median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 24 (10-43) months. There were 3119 patients who had lung cancer-related death during the follow-up period. The deep learning survival neural network model showed more promising results in the prediction of lung cancer-specific survival than the tumor, node, and metastasis stage on the test data set (C statistic = 0.739 vs 0.706). The population who received the recommended treatments had superior survival rates than those who received treatments not recommended (hazard ratio, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.49-3.59; P < .001), which was verified by propensity score-matched groups. The deep learning survival neural network model visualization was realized by a user-friendly graphic interface.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The deep learning survival neural network model shows potential benefits in prognostic evaluation and treatment recommendation with respect to lung cancer-specific survival.

It is, consequently, an expensive process that can, in addition, suffer from geospatial discrepancies, thus severely impairing the comparability of death statistics at the international level. The recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, has enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems that were typically considered out of reach without human assistance; they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. However, the CépiDc (Centre d'épidémiologie sur les causes médicales de Décès) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of training examples available for the machine learning practitioner.
OBJECTIVE: This article investigates the application of deep neural network methods to coding underlying causes of death.
METHODS: The investigated dataset was based on data contained from every French death certificate from 2000 to 2015, containing information such as the subject's age and gender, as well as the chain of events leading to his or her death, for a total of around 8 million observations. The task of automatically coding the subject's underlying cause of death was then formulated as a predictive modelling problem. A deep neural network-based model was then designed and fit to the dataset. Its error rate was then assessed on an exterior test dataset and compared to the current state-of-the-art (ie, the Iris software). Statistical significance of the proposed approach's superiority was assessed via bootstrap.
RESULTS: The proposed approach resulted in a test accuracy of 97.8% (95% CI 97.7-97.9), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art and its accuracy of 74.5% (95% CI 74.0-75.0) assessed on the same test example. Such an improvement opens up a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level batch-automated coding to international and temporal harmonization of cause of death statistics. A typical example of such an application is demonstrated by recoding French overdose-related deaths from 2000 to 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: This article shows that deep artificial neural networks are perfectly suited to the analysis of electronic health records and can learn a complex set of medical rules directly from voluminous datasets, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived algorithm constitutes a powerful decision-making tool that is able to handle structured medical data with an unprecedented performance. We strongly believe that the methods developed in this article are highly reusable in a variety of settings related to epidemiology, biostatistics, and the medical sciences in general.",other,Not specified

We compare the performance of the HiSAN against other machine learning and deep learning approaches commonly used on medical text data - Naive Bayes, logistic regression, convolutional neural networks, and hierarchical attention networks (the previous state-of-the-art). We show that HiSANs are superior to other machine learning and deep learning text classifiers in both accuracy and macro F-score across all five classification tasks.

Participants were partitioned into nonoverlapping sets of 2407 for algorithm training, 100 for validation and parameter tuning, and 7143 for testing. A deep learning algorithm using convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architectures was trained to classify pattern of emphysema according to Fleischner criteria. Deep learning scores were compared with visual scores and clinical parameters including pulmonary function tests. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate relationships between emphysema scores and survival. The algorithm was also tested by using CT and clinical data in 1962 participants enrolled in the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE) study.ResultsA total of 7143 COPDGene participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 59.8 years ± 8.9; 3734 men and 3409 women) were evaluated. Deep learning emphysema classifications were associated with impaired pulmonary function tests, 6-minute walk distance, and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire at univariate analysis (P &lt; .001 for each). Testing in the ECLIPSE cohort showed similar associations (P &lt; .001). In the COPDGene test cohort, deep learning emphysema classification improved the fit of linear mixed models in the prediction of these clinical parameters compared with visual scoring (P &lt; .001).

The deep learning system (DLS) recently showed promising diagnostic performance for diabetic retinopathy (DR). This study aims to use DLS as the grading tool, instead of human assessors, to determine the prevalence and the systemic cardiovascular risk factors for DR on fundus photographs, in patients with diabetes. This is a multi-ethnic (5 races), multi-site (8 datasets from Singapore, USA, Hong Kong, China and Australia), cross-sectional study involving 18,912 patients (n = 93,293 images). We compared these results and the time taken for DR assessment by DLS versus 17 human assessors - 10 retinal specialists/ophthalmologists and 7 professional graders). The estimation of DR prevalence between DLS and human assessors is comparable for any DR, referable DR and vision-threatening DR (VTDR) (Human assessors: 15.9, 6.5% and 4.1%; DLS: 16.1%, 6.4%, 3.7%). Both assessment methods identified similar risk factors (with comparable AUCs), including younger age, longer diabetes duration, increased HbA1c and systolic blood pressure, for any DR, referable DR and VTDR (p &gt; 0.05). The total time taken for DLS to evaluate DR from 93,293 fundus photographs was ~1 month compared to 2 years for human assessors. In conclusion, the prevalence and systemic risk factors for DR in multi-ethnic population could be determined accurately using a DLS, in significantly less time than human assessors. This study highlights the potential use of AI for future epidemiology or clinical trials for DR grading in the global communities.",other,Not specified

We expected to predict survival of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) with machine learning, and compared it with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Methods: Data of PNETs cases were extracted from The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database. Statistic description, multivariate survival analysis and preprocessing were done before machine learning. Four different algorithms (logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF) and deep learning (DL)) were used to train the model. We used proper imputations to manage missing data in the database and sensitive analysis was performed to evaluate the imputation. The model with the best predictive accuracy was compared with the AJCC staging system using the SEER cases. Results: The four models had similar predictive accuracy with no significant difference existed (p = 0.664). The DL model showed a slightly better predictive accuracy than others (81.6% (± 1.9%)), thus it was used for further comparison with the AJCC staging system and revealed a better performance for PNETs cases in SEER database (Area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.87 vs 0.76). The validity of missing data imputation was supported by sensitivity analysis.

These studies extensively adopt univariate analysis by ignoring interaction effects. It is widely accepted that the etiology of most complex diseases depends on interactions between genetic variants and / or environmental factors. Several machine learning and data mining methods have been consistently successful in exposing these interaction effects. However, there has been no major breakthrough due to various biological complexities, and statistical computational challenges facing in the field of genetic epidemiology, despite of many efforts. Deep learning is emerging machine learning approach that promises to reveal the hidden patterns of big data for accurate predictions. In this study, a deep neural network is unified with a random forest by forming hybrid architecture, for achieving reliable detection of multi-locus interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms. The proposed hybrid method is evaluated on various simulated scenarios in the absence of main effect for six epistasis models. The best model with optimal hyper-parameters (grid and random grid search) is chosen to enhance the power of the method by maximising the model's prediction accuracy. The performance metrics of each model is analysed for both training and validation. Further, the performance of the method in the presence of noise due to missing data, genotyping errors, genetic heterogeneity, and phenocopy, and their combined effects are evaluated. The power of the method in detecting two-locus interactions is compared with the previous methods in the presence and absence of noise. On an average, the power of the proposed method is much higher than the previous methods for all simulated scenarios. Finally, findings are confirmed on a chronical dialysis patient's data, obtained from the published study performed at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.

However, no study has analyzed the influence of protocol features on the probability that a study's results will be finally reported, thereby indirectly assessing the reporting bias of International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) registration records.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to explore which factors are associated with a higher probability that results derived from a non-Cochrane PROSPERO registration record for a systematic review will be finally reported as an original article in a scientific journal.
METHODS/DESIGN: The PROSPERO repository will be web scraped to automatically and iteratively obtain all completed non-Cochrane registration records stored from February 2011 to December 2017. Downloaded records will be screened, and those with less than 90% fulfilled or are duplicated (i.e., those sharing titles and reviewers) will be excluded. Manual and human-supervised automatic methods will be used for data extraction, depending on the data source (fields of PROSPERO registration records, bibliometric databases, etc.). Records will be classified into published, discontinued, and abandoned review subgroups. All articles derived from published reviews will be obtained through multiple parallel searches using the full protocol ""title"" and/or ""list reviewers"" in MEDLINE/PubMed databases and Google Scholar. Reviewer, author, article, and journal metadata will be obtained using different sources. R and Python programming and analysis languages will be used to describe the datasets; perform text mining, machine learning, and deep learning analyses; and visualize the data. We will report the study according to the recommendations for meta-epidemiological studies adapted from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for SRs and MAs.

Adoption of an artificial intelligence tool in clinical practice requires careful confirmation of its clinical utility. Herein, the authors explain key methodology points involved in a clinical evaluation of artificial intelligence technology for use in medicine, especially high-dimensional or overparameterized diagnostic or predictive models in which artificial deep neural networks are used, mainly from the standpoints of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics. First, statistical methods for assessing the discrimination and calibration performances of a diagnostic or predictive model are summarized. Next, the effects of disease manifestation spectrum and disease prevalence on the performance results are explained, followed by a discussion of the difference between evaluating the performance with use of internal and external datasets, the importance of using an adequate external dataset obtained from a well-defined clinical cohort to avoid overestimating the clinical performance as a result of overfitting in high-dimensional or overparameterized classification model and spectrum bias, and the essentials for achieving a more robust clinical evaluation. Finally, the authors review the role of clinical trials and observational outcome studies for ultimate clinical verification of diagnostic or predictive artificial intelligence tools through patient outcomes, beyond performance metrics, and how to design such studies. © RSNA, 2018.",other,Not specified

We observe a constant increase in carcinomas, risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, especially in transplant recipients where skin cancer mortality is important. Among epidemiological developments in melanoma are increased mortality despite screening, occupational exposure to UV, second melanoma and higher risk after carcinoma. New classifications that should be considered are AJCC8 for melanoma and carcinoma. In a near future artificial intelligence could change skin cancer screening practices through deep learning. For the sentinel lymph node, there is no interest in systematic lymphadenectomy that does not improve survival. Radiation therapy is essential for the prognosis of Merkel's carcinoma, and Mohs' surgery can be of interest. In metastatic melanoma, results on immunotherapy and targeted treatments include duration, dose, combinations, and the study of resistance mechanisms. The great novelty is immunotherapy or targeted therapy as an adjuvant treatment, giving an improvement in survival without relapse.",other,Not specified

These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed.
RESULTS: Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential new directions, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of data mining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology.
CONCLUSIONS: We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data. This suggests that many more fruitful applications can be expected in the future.",other,Not specified

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for our analyses were obtained from 942 deidentiﬁed pathology reports collected by the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. The HAN was implemented for 2 information extraction tasks: (1) primary site, matched to 12 International Classification of Diseases for Oncology topography codes (7 breast, 5 lung primary sites), and (2) histological grade classiﬁcation, matched to G1-G4. Model performance metrics were compared to conventional machine learning (ML) approaches including naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting, and other DL models, including a recurrent neural network (RNN), a recurrent neural network with attention (RNN w/A), and a convolutional neural network.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that for both information tasks, HAN performed signiﬁcantly better compared to the conventional ML and DL techniques. In particular, across the 2 tasks, the mean micro and macro F-scores for the HAN with pretraining were (0.852,0.708), compared to naive Bayes (0.518, 0.213), logistic regression (0.682, 0.453), support vector machine (0.634, 0.434), random forest (0.698, 0.508), extreme gradient boosting (0.696, 0.522), RNN (0.505, 0.301), RNN w/A (0.637, 0.471), and convolutional neural network (0.714, 0.460).

It is crucial to characterize the disease and the evolution of the ongoing epidemic efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model the disease progress and underlying contact network, but suffers from the lack of real-time and fine-grained surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and detailed disease surveillance, but is insensible to the underlying contact network and disease model. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised deep learning framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques. Specifically, this framework learns the social media users' health states and intervention actions in real time, which are regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. Conversely, the learned knowledge from social media can be fed into computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm to substantialize the above interactive learning process iteratively to achieve a consistent stage of the integration. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that our approach can effectively characterize the spatio-temporal disease diffusion, outperforming competing methods by a substantial margin on multiple metrics.",transformer/generative,Not specified

A major reason for this has been the lack of availability of patient data to the broader ML research community, in large part due to patient privacy protection concerns. High-quality, realistic, synthetic datasets can be leveraged to accelerate methodological developments in medicine. By and large, medical data is high dimensional and often categorical. These characteristics pose multiple modeling challenges.
METHODS: In this paper, we evaluate three classes of synthetic data generation approaches; probabilistic models, classification-based imputation models, and generative adversarial neural networks. Metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated synthetic datasets are presented and discussed.
RESULTS: While the results and discussions are broadly applicable to medical data, for demonstration purposes we generate synthetic datasets for cancer based on the publicly available cancer registry data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Specifically, our cohort consists of breast, respiratory, and non-solid cancer cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2015, which includes over 360,000 individual cases.

Due to the high volume of online misinformation in recent years, there is a need to continue advancing methodologies in order to effectively identify narratives and themes. While machine learning models can be used to detect misinformation and conspiracies, these models are limited in their generalizability to other datasets and misinformation phenomenon, and are often unable to detect implicit meanings in text that require contextual knowledge. To rapidly detect evolving conspiracist narratives within high volume online discourse while identifying nuanced themes requiring the comprehension of subtext, this study describes a hybrid methodology that combines natural language processing (i.e., topic modeling and sentiment analysis) with qualitative content coding approaches to characterize conspiracy discourse related to 5G wireless technology and COVID-19 on Twitter (currently known as 'X'). Discourse that focused on correcting 5G conspiracies was also analyzed for comparison. Sentiment analysis shows that conspiracy-related discourse was more likely to use language that was analytic, combative, past-oriented, referenced social status, and expressed negative emotions. Corrections discourse was more likely to use words reflecting cognitive processes, prosocial relations, health-related consequences, and future-oriented language. Inductive coding characterized conspiracist narratives related to global elites, anti-vax sentiment, medical authorities, religious figures, and false correlations between technology advancements and disease outbreaks. Further, the corrections discourse did not address many of the narratives prevalent in conspiracy conversations. This paper aims to further bridge the gap between computational and qualitative methodologies by demonstrating how both approaches can be used in tandem to emphasize the positive aspects of each methodology while minimizing their respective drawbacks.",text mining,Not specified

Consequently, we conducted the largest to date series of samples of both types and employed machine learning (ML) to assess treatment effectiveness and develop accurate prognostic models for patients with GTN. Gestational choriocarcinoma (GCC) was used as the control group to show the clinical features of PTSS and ETT.
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database provided the data used for this study's analysis. To identify the prognostic variables, we conducted Cox regression analysis and constructed prognostic models using five ML algorithms to predict the 5-year survival. A validation method incorporating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to validate the accuracy and reliability of the ML models. We also investigated the role of multiple therapeutic options using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 725 patients. Among them, 139 patients had ETT, 107 had PSTT, and 479 had GCC. There were no significant differences in survival between the different tumor groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that metastasis was a significant prognostic factor for GCC, while older age and radiotherapy were significant prognostic factors for PTSS and ETT. ML models revealed that the Gradient Boosting classifier accurately predicted the outcomes, followed by the random forest classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and multilayer perceptron models. The most significant contributing factors were tumor size, year of diagnosis, age, and race.
DISCUSSION: Our study provides a method for treatment and prognostic assessment of patients with GTN. The ML we developed can be used as a convenient individualized tool to facilitate clinical decision making.",other,Not specified

The aim was to develop a machine-learning model for predicting the risk of distant metastasis in patients with neuroblastoma to aid clinical diagnosis and treatment decisions.
METHODS: We built a predictive model using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2018 on 1,542 patients with neuroblastoma. Seven machine-learning methods were employed to forecast the likelihood of neuroblastoma distant metastases. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent risk factors for building machine learning models. Secondly, the subject operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC), Precision-Recall (PR) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curves were used to assess model performance. To further explain the optimal model, the Shapley summation interpretation method (SHAP) was applied. Ultimately, the best model was used to create an online calculator that estimates the likelihood of neuroblastoma distant metastases.
RESULTS: The study included 1,542 patients with neuroblastoma, multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that age, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, primary site, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were independent risk factors for distant metastasis of neuroblastoma (P &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression (LR) was found to be the optimal algorithm among the seven constructed, with the highest AUC values of 0.835 and 0.850 in the training and validation sets, respectively.

Its epidemiological features, treatment principles, and prognostic factors remain controversial.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an improved machine learning-based model to predict the prognosis of patients with invasive micropapillary carcinoma.
METHODS: A total of 1123 patients diagnosed with IMPC after surgery between 1998 and 2019 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for survival analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore independent prognostic factors for the overall and disease-specific survival of patients with IMPC. Five machine learning algorithms were developed to predict the 5-year survival of these patients.
RESULTS: Cox regression analysis indicated that patients aged > 65 years had a significantly worse prognosis than those younger in age, while unmarried patients had a better prognosis than married patients. Patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2005 had a significant risk reduction of mortality compared with other periods. The XGBoost model outperformed the other models with a precision of 0.818 and an area under the curve of 0.863.
CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning model for IMPC in patients with breast cancer was developed to estimate the 5-year OS. The XGBoost model had a promising performance and can help clinicians determine the early prognosis of patients with IMPC; therefore, the model can improve clinical outcomes by influencing management strategies and patient health care decisions.",other,Not specified

There are several methods for measuring fat intake, each with its own strengths and limitations. Guidelines for nutritional epidemiology studies recommend employing objective biomarkers. This study aimed to estimate fatty acid intake based on serum fatty acid levels using multiple regression analysis and a machine learning technique, and to compare their accuracy. The subjects were healthy women aged 18 to 64 living in Toyama, Japan. A dietary survey to determine fatty acid intake was conducted using a 3-day dietary record completed by the participant. Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast, and serum was obtained through centrifugation. A total of 300 women participated in the study. The fatty acid levels in serum were determined using gas chromatography with a capillary column. Using multiple regression analysis and neural networks, the intakes of saturated, monounsaturated, n-6 polyunsaturated, n-3 polyunsaturated, and trans fatty acids from serum fatty acid levels were predicted. Significant correlations were observed between the intakes of the five classified fatty acids and the predicted intakes obtained from the multiple regression analysis (r = 0.39 - 0.49, p < 0.01). Significant correlations were also observed between the five classified fatty acid intakes and the intakes predicted by the neural network (r = 0.52 - 0.79, p < 0.01), and the correlation coefficient showed a significantly higher value than that predicted by the multiple regression analysis. These results suggest that serum fatty acid levels may be used as biomarkers to estimate the intake of fatty acids, including that of trans fatty acids, and that machine learning may be able to predict fatty acid intake with higher accuracy than multiple regression analysis.",other,Not specified

We aimed to develop and test 6-month, 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) prediction models for gastric cancer patients following gastrectomy.
METHODS: We derived and tested Survival Quilts, a machine learning-based model, to develop 6-month, 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS and CSS prediction models. Gastrectomy patients in the development set (n = 20,583) and the internal validation set (n = 5,106) were recruited from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, while those in the external validation set (n = 6,352) were recruited from the China National Cancer Center Gastric Cancer (NCCGC) database.

This ecologic study investigated the association between domestic radon exposure and childhood cancer risk in a large sample of United States (U.S.) counties.
METHODS: Monthly ZIP code-level basement radon estimates from a geographic machine learning model were aggregated annually to counties, analyzed as continuous and dichotomized (cut point: 74 Bq/cubic meter (Bq/m3) or 2.0 picocuries/L (pCi/L)) versions, and lagged by one year. Annual county-level counts of sex- and site-specific (all, leukemia, brain and central nervous system [CNS], and other sites) incident cancer diagnoses among those 0-19 years from 2001 to 2018 were obtained from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database. Sex- and site-specific counts were modeled as zero-inflated Poisson distributions in a Bayesian spatiotemporal framework and sequentially adjusted for random and fixed confounder effects.
RESULTS: In 727 counties across 14 states, the average population aged 0-19 years was 41,599 people at baseline. Results from fully adjusted spatiotemporal statistical models indicated 1.05 (95% credible interval, CrI: 1.00, 1.09) times higher relative risks (RRs) of leukemia among both sexes and a RR of 1.06 (95%CrI: 1.00, 1.12) in males from a 50 Bq/m3 (1.35 pCi/L) increase in radon concentration the year prior. For radon exposures ≥74 Bq/m3 (2.00 pCi/L) the year prior, RRs were 1.08 (95%CrI: 1.02, 1.15) for both sexes and 1.12 (95%CrI: 1.04, 1.22) for females. No associations were found with other cancer sites or sexes from prior year radon exposures.
CONCLUSIONS: County-level childhood leukemia risk in both sexes were associated with average radon levels below U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines recommending mitigation (148 Bq/m3 or 4.00 pCi/L). These findings warrant further investigation using population-based and individual-level study designs.",other,Not specified

Online ahead of print.,Yi N,J Nurs Scholarsh,2024,2024/09/12,,,10.1111/jnu.13024,"INTRODUCTION: Accurate and rapid triage can reduce undertriage and overtriage, which may improve emergency department flow. This study aimed to identify the effects of a prospective study applying artificial intelligence-based triage in the clinical field.
DESIGN: Systematic review of prospective studies.
METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, ProQuest, KISS, and RISS were searched from March 9 to April 18, 2023. All the data were screened independently by three researchers. The review included prospective studies that measured outcomes related to AI-based triage. Three researchers extracted data and independently assessed the study's quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) protocol.
RESULTS: Of 1633 studies, seven met the inclusion criteria for this review. Most studies applied machine learning to triage, and only one was based on fuzzy logic. All studies, except one, utilized a five-level triage classification system. Regarding model performance, the feed-forward neural network achieved a precision of 33% in the level 1 classification, whereas the fuzzy clip model achieved a specificity and sensitivity of 99%. The accuracy of the model's triage prediction ranged from 80.5% to 99.1%. Other outcomes included time reduction, overtriage and undertriage checks, mistriage factors, and patient care and prognosis outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Triage nurses in the emergency department can use artificial intelligence as a supportive means for triage. Ultimately, we hope to be a resource that can reduce undertriage and positively affect patient health.

In the context of a deliberately released pathogen, such as Bacillus anthracis (the disease-causing organism of anthrax), this can allow responders to quickly identify the location and timing of the release, as well as other factors such as the strength of the release, and the realized wind speed and direction at release. These estimates can then be used to parameterise a predictive mechanistic model, allowing for estimation of the potential scale of the release, and to optimise the distribution of prophylaxis. In this paper we present two novel approaches to reverse epidemiology, and demonstrate their utility in responding to a simulated deliberate release of B. anthracis in ten locations in the UK and compare these to the standard grid-search approach. The two methods-a modified MCMC and a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network-are able to identify the source location and timing of the release with significantly better accuracy compared to the grid-search approach. Further, the neural network method is able to do inference on new data significantly quicker than either the grid-search or novel MCMC methods, allowing for rapid deployment in time-sensitive outbreaks.",other,Not specified

Over the last few years, machine learning techniques have been used to predict metabolic syndrome. However, studies incorporating demographic, clinical, laboratory, dietary, and genetic factors to predict the incidence of metabolic syndrome in Koreans are limited. In the present study, we propose a genome-wide polygenic risk score for the prediction of metabolic syndrome, along with other factors, to improve the prediction accuracy of metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: We developed 7 machine learning-based models and used Cox multivariable regression, deep neural network (DNN), support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), random forest (RAF), Naïve Bayes (NBA) classifier, and AdaBoost (ADB) to predict the incidence of metabolic syndrome at year 14 using the dataset from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) Ansan and Ansung.
RESULTS: Of the 5440 patients, 2,120 were considered to have new-onset metabolic syndrome. The AUC values of model, which included sex, age, alcohol intake, energy intake, marital status, education status, income status, smoking status, dried laver intake, and genome-wide polygenic risk score (gPRS) Z-score based on 344,447 SNPs (p-value < 1.0), were the highest for RAF (0.994 [95% CI 0.985, 1.000]) and ADB (0.994 [95% CI 0.986, 1.000]).
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating both gPRS and demographic, clinical, laboratory, and seaweed data led to enhanced metabolic syndrome risk prediction by capturing the distinct etiologies of metabolic syndrome development. The RAF- and ADB-based models predicted metabolic syndrome more accurately than the NBA-based model for the Korean population.",other,Not specified

This study aims to develop a deep neural network capable of predicting mortality in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.
METHODS: Leveraging data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we developed Thy-DAMP (Deep Artificial Neural Network Model for Prediction of Thyroid Cancer) to forecast mortality in DTC patients. The dataset comprised demographic, histologic, and staging information. Following data normalization and feature encoding, the dataset was partitioned into training, testing, and validation subsets, with model hyperparameters fine-tuned via cross-validation.
RESULTS: Among the 63,513 patients, the mean age was 48.22 years (SD = 14.8), with 77.32% being female. Papillary carcinoma emerged as the predominant subtype, representing 62.94% of cases. The majority presented with stage I disease (73.96%). Thy-DAMP demonstrated acceptable performance metrics on both the test and validation sets. Sensitivity was 83.24% (95% CI 76.95-88.40%), specificity was 93.53% (95% CI 93.01-94.02%), and accuracy stood at 93.33% (95% CI 92.82-93.83%). The model exhibited a positive predictive value of 19.76% (95% CI 18.20-21.42%) and a negative predictive value of 99.66% (95% CI 99.53-99.75%). Additionally, Thy-DAMP demonstrated a positive likelihood ratio of 12.86 (95% CI 11.62-14.23), a negative likelihood ratio of 0.18 (95% CI 0.13-0.25), and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.95. The model was externally validated on a separate dataset with nearly identical performance.
CONCLUSION: Thy-DAMP showcases considerable promise in accurately predicting mortality in DTC patients, leveraging limited set of patient data.",other,Not specified

Due to the immature immune system in children, the prognosis of DLBCL is quite different from that of adults. We aim to use the multicenter large retrospective analysis for prognosis study of the disease.
METHODS: For our retrospective analysis, we retrieved data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database that included 836 DLBCL patients under 18 years old who were treated at 22 central institutions between 2000 and 2019. The patients were randomly divided into a modeling group and a validation group based on the ratio of 7:3. Cox stepwise regression, generalized Cox regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used to screen all variables. The selected prognostic variables were used to construct a nomogram through Cox stepwise regression. The importance of variables was ranked using XGBoost. The predictive performance of the model was assessed by using C-index, area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity and specificity. The consistency of the model was evaluated by using a calibration curve. The clinical practicality of the model was verified through decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: ROC curve demonstrated that all models except the non-proportional hazards and non-log linearity (NPHNLL) model, achieved AUC values above 0.7, indicating high accuracy. The calibration curve and DCA further confirmed strong predictive performance and clinical practicability.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we successfully constructed a machine learning model by combining XGBoost with Cox and generalized Cox regression models. This integrated approach accurately predicts the prognosis of children with DLBCL from multiple dimensions. These findings provide a scientific basis for accurate clinical prognosis prediction.",other,Not specified

METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for 4,727 patients with NM based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Their clinicopathological characteristics were retrospectively reviewed, and logistic regression analysis was utilized to identify risk factors for metastasis. This was followed by employing Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Adaptive Boosting (AB), Bagging (BAG), logistic regression (LR), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithms to develop metastasis models. The performance of the six models was evaluated and compared, leading to the selection and visualization of the optimal model. Through integrating the prognostic factors of Cox regression analysis with the optimal models, the prognostic prediction model was constructed, validated, and assessed.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses identified that marital status, gender, primary site, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, system management, and N stage were all independent risk factors for NM metastasis. MLP emerged as the optimal model among the six models (AUC = 0.932, F1 = 0.855, Accuracy = 0.856, Sensitivity = 0.878), and the corresponding network calculator (https://shimunana-nm-distant-m-nm-m-distant-8z8k54.streamlit.app/) was developed. The following were examined as independent prognostic factors: MLP, age, marital status, sequence number, laterality, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, system management, T stage, and N stage. System management and surgery emerged as protective factors (HR < 1). To predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS), a nomogram was created. The validation results demonstrated that the model exhibited good discrimination and consistency, as well as high clinical usefulness.
CONCLUSION: The developed prediction model more effectively reflects the prognosis of patients with NM and differentiates between the risk level of patients, serving as a useful supplement to the classical American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system and offering a reference for clinically stratified individualized treatment and prognosis prediction. Furthermore, the model enables clinicians to quantify the risk of metastasis in NM patients, assess patient survival, and administer precise treatments.",other,Not specified

The diverse symptoms and uncommon nature of MSO can create difficulties in its diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to analyze data and use machine learning methods to understand the prognostic factors and potential management strategies for MSO.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database provided the data used for this study's analysis. To identify the prognostic variables, we conducted Cox regression analysis and constructed prognostic models using five machine learning algorithms to predict the 5-year survival. A validation method incorporating the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to validate the accuracy and reliability of the machine learning models. We also investigated the role of multiple therapeutic options using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 329 patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that older age, unmarried status, chemotherapy, and the total number of tumors in patients were poor prognostic factors. Machine learning models revealed that the multilayer perceptron accurately predicted outcomes, followed by the random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, K-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression models. The factors that contributed the most were age, marital status, and the total number of tumors in the patients.

The conventional survival nomogram used to predict lung cancer performs poorly for SRCC. Therefore, a novel nomogram specifically for studying SRCC is highly required.
METHODS: Baseline characteristics of lung signet ring cell carcinoma were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression and random forest analysis were performed on the training group data, respectively. Subsequently, we compared results from these two types of analyses. A nomogram model was developed to predict 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival (OS) for patients, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves were used to assess the prediction accuracy. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess the clinical applicability of the proposed model. For treatment modalities, Kaplan-Meier curves were adopted to analyze condition-specific effects.
RESULTS: We obtained 731 patients diagnosed with lung signet ring cell carcinoma (LSRCC) in the SEER database and randomized the patients into a training group (551) and a validation group (220) with a ratio of 7:3. Eight factors including age, primary site, T, N, and M.Stage, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation were included in the nomogram analysis. Results suggested that treatment methods (like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation) and T-Stage factors had significant prognostic effects. The results of ROC curves, calibration curves, and DCA in the training and validation groups demonstrated that the nomogram we constructed could precisely predict survival and prognosis in LSRCC patients. Through deep verification, we found the constructed model had a high C-index, indicating that the model had a strong predictive power. Further, we found that all surgical interventions had good effects on OS and cancer-specific survival (CSS). The survival curves showed a relatively favorable prognosis for T0 patients overall, regardless of the treatment modality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our nomogram is demonstrated to be clinically beneficial for the prognosis of LSRCC patients. The surgical intervention was successful regardless of the tumor stage, and the Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model had better performance than the machine learning model in terms of effectiveness.",other,Not specified

Implementing public health interventions in the field of epidemiology depends on efficient modeling and outbreak prediction. Because RNNs can capture sequential dependencies in data, they have become highly effective tools in this field. In this paper, the use of RNNs in epidemic modeling is examined, with a focus on the extent to which they can handle the inherent temporal dynamics in the spread of diseases. The mathematical representation of epidemics requires taking time-dependent variables into account, such as the rate at which infections spread and the long-term effects of interventions. The goal of this study is to use an intelligent computing solution based on RNNs to provide numerical performances and interpretations for the SEIR nonlinear system based on the propagation of the Zika virus (SEIRS-PZV) model. The four patient dynamics, namely susceptible patients S(y), exposed patients admitted in a hospital E(y), the fraction of infective individuals I(y), and recovered patients R(y), are represented by the epidemic version of the nonlinear system, or the SEIR model. SEIRS-PZV is represented by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are then solved by the Adams method using the Mathematica software to generate a dataset. The dataset was used as an output for the RNN to train the model and examine results such as regressions, correlations, error histograms, etc. For RNN, we used 100% to train the model with 15 hidden layers and a delay of 2 seconds. The input for the RNN is a time series sequence from 0 to 5, with a step size of 0.05. In the end, we compared the approximated solution with the exact solution by plotting them on the same graph and generating the absolute error plot for each of the 4 cases of SEIRS-PZV. Predictions made by the model appeared to be become more accurate when the mean squared error (MSE) decreased. An increased fit to the observed data was suggested by this decrease in the MSE, which suggested that the variance between the model's predicted values and the actual values was dropping. A minimal absolute error almost equal to zero was obtained, which further supports the usefulness of the suggested strategy. A small absolute error shows the degree to which the model's predictions matches the ground truth values, thus indicating the level of accuracy and precision for the model's output.",other,Not specified

Despite this, there is a dearth of research utilizing big data to predict UM distant metastasis. This study leveraged machine learning methods on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to forecast the risk probability of distant metastasis. Therefore, the information on UM patients from the SEER database (2000-2020) was split into a 7:3 ratio training set and an internal test set based on distant metastasis presence. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed distant metastasis risk factors. Six machine learning methods constructed a predictive model post-feature variable selection. The model evaluation identified the multilayer perceptron (MLP) as optimal. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) interpreted the chosen model. A web-based calculator personalized risk probabilities for UM patients. The results show that nine feature variables contributed to the machine learning model. The MLP model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy (Precision = 0.788; ROC AUC = 0.876; PR AUC = 0.788). Grade recode, age, primary site, time from diagnosis to treatment initiation, and total number of malignant tumors were identified as distant metastasis risk factors. Diagnostic method, laterality, rural-urban continuum code, and radiation recode emerged as protective factors. The developed web calculator utilizes the MLP model for personalized risk assessments. In conclusion, the MLP machine learning model emerges as the optimal tool for predicting distant metastasis in UM patients.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a neural network model based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) for evaluating GFR in Chinese NLUTD patients, and compare the diagnostic performance with Cr-based multiple linear regression equations for Chinese and the CKD-EPI<sub>cr</sub> equation without race.
DESIGN: Single-center, cross-sectional study of GFR estimation from serum Cr, demographic data, and clinical characteristics in Chinese patients with NLUTD.
PATIENTS: A total of 204 NLUTD patients, from 27 different geographic regions of China, were selected. A random sample of 141 of these subjects was included in the training sample set, and the remaining 63 patients were included in the testing sample set.
METHODS: The reference GFR (rGFR) was assessed by the technetium-99m-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) double plasma sample method. A neural network model based on MLP was developed to evaluate GFR in the training sample set, which was then validated in the testing sample set and compared with Cr-based GFR equations.
RESULTS: The MLP-based model showed significant performance improvement in evaluating the difference, absolute difference, precision, and accuracy of GFR estimation compared with the Cr-based GFR equations. Additionally, compared with the rGFR, we found that the MLP-based model provided an acceptable level of accuracy (greater than 85%, which was within a 30% deviation from the rGFR).

The RF model demonstrated accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F1 score, and AUC (95% CI) values of 0.792 (0.762-0.823), 0.904 (0.835-0.973), 0.759 (0.731-0.787), 0.221 (0.186-0.256), 0.974 (0.967-0.982), 0.353 (0.306-0.399), and 0.834 (0.696-0.967), respectively, surpassing the performance of other models. Additionally, the calibration curve's Brier Score (95%) for the RF model reached the minimum value of 0.06256 (0.05753-0.06759). SHAP analysis provided independent explanations, reaffirming the critical clinical factors associated with the risk of metastasis in OCCC patients.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study including patients who were newly diagnosed with AFib with a record of cancer from the 2012-2018 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. The ML algorithms were developed and validated separately for each outcome by fitting elastic net, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network models with tenfold cross-validation (train:test = 7:3). We obtained area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and F2 score as performance metrics. Model calibration was assessed using Brier score. In sensitivity analysis, we resampled data using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Among 18,388 patients with AFib and cancer, 523 (2.84%) had ischemic stroke and 221 (1.20%) had major bleeding within one year after AFib diagnosis. In prediction of ischemic stroke, RF significantly outperformed other ML models [AUC (0.916, 95% CI 0.887-0.945), sensitivity 0.868, specificity 0.801, F2 score 0.375, Brier score = 0.035].

The presence of bone metastasis has a profound adverse impact on patient prognosis. However, to date, there is a lack of accurate bone metastasis prediction models. As a result, this study aims to employ machine learning algorithms for predicting the risk of bone metastasis in patients.
METHOD: We collected a dataset comprising 19,454 cases of solitary, primary lung adenocarcinoma with pulmonary nodules measuring less than 3 cm. These cases were diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 and were sourced from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Utilizing clinical feature indicators, we developed predictive models using seven machine learning algorithms, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression (LR), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM).
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that XGBoost exhibited superior performance among the four algorithms (training set: AUC: 0.913; test set: AUC: 0.853).

The co-existence of these pathogens in overlapping regions complicates effective disease control strategies. This study aimed to clarify the distribution and interaction of these diseases within Southeast Asia.
METHODS: We systematically collated occurrence records of human clonorchiasis (n = 1809) and opisthorchiasis (n = 731) across the Southeast Asia countries. Utilizing species distribution models incorporating environmental and climatic data, coupled machine learning algorithms with boosted regression trees, we predicted and distinguished endemic areas for each fluke species. Machine learning techniques, including geospatial analysis, were employed to delineate the boundaries between these flukes.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that the endemic range of C. sinensis and O. viverrini in Southeast Asia primarily spans across part of China, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the period from 2000 to 2018, we identified C. sinensis infections in 84 distinct locations, predominantly in southern China (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region) and northern Vietnam. In a stark contrast, O. viverrini was more widely distributed, with infections documented in 721 locations across Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Critical environmental determinants were quantitatively analyzed, revealing annual mean temperatures ranging between 14 and 20 °C in clonorchiasis-endemic areas and 24-30 °C in opisthorchiasis regions (P < 0.05). The machine learning model effectively mapped a distinct demarcation zone, demonstrating a clear separation between the endemic areas of these two liver flukes with AUC from 0.9 to1. The study in Vietnam delineates the coexistence and geographical boundaries of C. sinensis and O. viverrini, revealing distinct endemic zones and a transitional area where both liver fluke species overlap.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the critical role of specific climatic and environmental factors in influencing the geographical distribution of C. sinensis and O. viverrini. This spatial delineation offers valuable insights for integrated surveillance and control strategies, particularly in regions with sympatric transmission. The results underscore the need for tailored interventions, considering regional epidemiological variations. Future collaborations integrating eco-epidemiology, molecular epidemiology, and parasitology are essential to further elucidate the complex interplay of liver fluke distributions in Asia.",other,Not specified

There are few machine learning (ML) studies investigating the prognosis in the RCC literature which could also quantify the risk of postoperative recurrence of RCC patients and guide cancer patients to conduct individualized postoperative clinical management. This study evaluated the suitability of ML algorithms for survival prediction in patients with RCC.
METHODS: A total of 192,912 RCC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) were obtained from 2004 to 2015. Six ML algorithms including support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian method, decision tree, random forest, neural network, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were applied to predict overall survival (OS) of RCC.
RESULTS: Patients from the SEER with a median age of 62 years and the pathological types were clear cell RCC (47.6%), papillary RCC (9.5%), chromophobe RCC (4.0%) and others (4.1%) were collected. In the deleting patients with missing data, the highest accurate model was XGBoost [area under the curve (AUC) 67.0%]. In the deleting patients with missing data and survival time <5 years, the accuracy of random forest, neural network and XGBoost were high, with AUC of 80.8%, 81.5% and 81.8%, respectively.

Epub 2024 Feb 14.,Zhou H,J Biomed Inform,2024,2024/02/15,,,10.1016/j.jbi.2024.104607,"OBJECTIVES: Hypothesis Generation (HG) is a task that aims to uncover hidden associations between disjoint scientific terms, which influences innovations in prevention, treatment, and overall public health. Several recent studies strive to use Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn evolutional embeddings for HG. However, the complex spatiotemporal dependencies of term-pair relations will be difficult to depict due to the inherent recurrent structure. This paper aims to accurately model the temporal evolution of term-pair relations using only attention mechanisms, for capturing crucial information on inferring the future connectivities.
METHODS: This paper proposes a Temporal Attention Networks (TAN) to produce powerful spatiotemporal embeddings for Biomedical Hypothesis Generation. Specifically, we formulate HG problem as a future connectivity prediction task in a temporal attributed graph. Our TAN develops a Temporal Spatial Attention Module (TSAM) to establish temporal dependencies of node-pair (term-pair) embeddings between any two time-steps for smoothing spatiotemporal node-pair embeddings. Meanwhile, a Temporal Difference Attention Module (TDAM) is proposed to sharpen temporal differences of spatiotemporal embeddings for highlighting the historical changes of node-pair relations. As such, TAN can adaptively calibrate spatiotemporal embeddings by considering both continuity and difference of node-pair embeddings.
RESULTS: Three real-world biomedical term relationship datasets are constructed from PubMed papers. TAN significantly outperforms the best baseline with 12.03%, 4.59 and 2.34% Micro-F<sub>1</sub> Score improvement in Immunotherapy, Virology and Neurology, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAN can model complex spatiotemporal dependencies of term-pairs for explicitly capturing the temporal evolution of relation, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.
CONCLUSION: We proposed a novel TAN to learn spatiotemporal embeddings based on pure attention mechanisms for HG. TAN learns the evolution of relationships by modeling both the continuity and difference of temporal term-pair embeddings. The important spatiotemporal dependencies of term-pair relations are extracted based solely on attention mechanism for generating hypotheses.",other,Not specified

In Nepal, animal rabies has posed a significant challenge to public health. Because animals are the primary source of rabies in humans, a better understanding of rabies epidemiology in animals is necessary. The objectives of this study were to determine the correlation between rabies occurrences in dogs and livestock animals and to detect the trends and change points of the disease using longitudinal data. The nationwide rabies dataset from 2005 to 2018 was analyzed using cross-correlation, multiple change points, and time series methods. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Neural Network Autoregression (NNAR) were applied to the time series data. The results show a positive correlation between canine rabies and livestock rabies occurrences. Three significant change points were detected in the time series data, demonstrating that the occurrences were high in the initial years but stabilized before peaking to an upward trend in the final years of the study period. Nonetheless, there was no seasonality pattern in rabies occurrences. The most suitable models were ARIMA (2,1,2) and NNAR (5,1,4) <sub>(12)</sub>.

In this sense, wastewater-based epidemiology remains a powerful tool for supporting regional health administrations in assessing risk levels and acting accordingly. In this work, a dynamic artificial neural network (DANN) has been developed for predicting the number of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in hospitals in Valladolid (Spain). This model takes as inputs a wastewater epidemiology indicator for COVID-19 (concentration of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene reported from Valladolid Wastewater Treatment Plant), vaccination coverage, and past data of hospitalizations. The model considered both the instantaneous values of these variables and their historical evolution. Two study periods were selected (from May 2021 until September 2022 and from September 2022 to July 2023). During the first period, accurate predictions of hospitalizations (with an overall range between 6 and 171) were favored by the correlation of this indicator with N1 concentrations in wastewater (r = 0.43, p < 0.05), showing accurate forecasting for 1 day ahead and 5 days ahead. The second period's retraining strategy maintained the overall accuracy of the model despite lower hospitalizations. Furthermore, risk levels were assigned to each 1 day ahead prediction during the first and second periods, showing agreement with the level measured and reported by regional health authorities in 95 % and 93 % of cases, respectively. These results evidenced the potential of this novel DANN model for predicting COVID-19 hospitalizations based on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations at a regional scale.

Retrieving previous studies, we investigated that patients with schizophrenia were more likely to experience poor subjective well-being and various physical, psychiatric, and social comorbidities. These factors might have great potential for precisely classifying schizophrenia cases in order to estimate the prevalence. Machine learning has shown a positive impact on many fields, including epidemiology, due to its high-precision modeling capability. It has been applied in research on mental disorders. However, few studies have applied machine learning technology to the precise classification of schizophrenia cases by variables of demographic and health-related backgrounds, especially using large-scale web-based surveys.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to construct an artificial neural network (ANN) model that can accurately classify schizophrenia cases from large-scale Japanese web-based survey data and to verify the generalizability of the model.
METHODS: Data were obtained from a large Japanese internet research pooled panel (Rakuten Insight, Inc) in 2021. A total of 223 individuals, aged 20-75 years, having schizophrenia, and 1776 healthy controls were included. Answers to the questions in a web-based survey were formatted as 1 response variable (self-report diagnosed with schizophrenia) and multiple feature variables (demographic, health-related backgrounds, physical comorbidities, psychiatric comorbidities, and social comorbidities). An ANN was applied to construct a model for classifying schizophrenia cases. Logistic regression (LR) was used as a reference. The performances of the models and algorithms were then compared.
RESULTS: The model trained by the ANN performed better than LR in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.86 vs 0.78), accuracy (0.93 vs 0.91), and specificity (0.96 vs 0.94), while the model trained by LR showed better sensitivity (0.63 vs 0.56). Comparing the performances of the ANN and LR, the ANN was better in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (bootstrapping: 0.847 vs 0.773 and cross-validation: 0.81 vs 0.72), while LR performed better in terms of accuracy (0.894 vs 0.856). Sleep medication use, age, household income, and employment type were the top 4 variables in terms of importance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study constructed an ANN model to classify schizophrenia cases using web-based survey data. Our model showed a high internal validity. The findings are expected to provide evidence for estimating the prevalence of schizophrenia in the Japanese population and informing future epidemiological studies.",other,Not specified

Macrophage carbon load (MaCL) is a novel cytology method that quantifies lung deposition dose of black carbon, however it has limited feasibility in large-scale epidemiological study due to the labor-intensive manual counting.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between MaCL and episodic elevation of combustion particles; to develop artificial intelligence based counting algorithm for MaCL assay.
METHODS: Sputum slides were collected during episodic elevation of ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> (n = 49, daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> &gt; 10 µg/m3 for over 2 weeks due to wildfire smoke intrusion in summer and local wood burning in winter) and low PM<sub>2.5</sub> period (n = 39, 30-day average PM<sub>2.5</sub> &lt; 4 µg/m3) from the Lovelace Smokers cohort.
RESULTS: Over 98% individual carbon particles in macrophages had diameter &lt;1 µm. MaCL levels scored manually were highly responsive to episodic elevation of ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and also correlated with lung injury biomarker, plasma CC16. The association with CC16 became more robust when the assessment focused on macrophages with higher carbon load. A Machine-Learning algorithm for Engulfed cArbon Particles (MacLEAP) was developed based on the Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network. MacLEAP algorithm yielded excellent correlations with manual counting for number and area of the particles. The algorithm produced associations with ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and plasma CC16 that were nearly identical in magnitude to those obtained through manual counting.

By sampling wastewater and applying WBE methods, wastewater-detectable pathogens such as viruses can be cheaply and effectively monitored, tracking people who might be missed or under-represented in traditional disease surveillance. There is a gap in current knowledge in combining hydraulic modeling with WBE. Recent literature has also identified a gap in combining machine learning with WBE for the detection of viral outbreaks. In this study, we loosely coupled a physically-based hydraulic model of pathogen introduction and transport with a machine learning model to track and trace the source of a pathogen within a sewer network and to evaluate its usefulness under various conditions. The methodology developed was applied to a hypothetical sewer network for the rapid detection of disease hotspots of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results showed that the machine learning model's ability to recognize hotspots is promising, but requires a high time-resolution of monitoring data and is highly sensitive to the sewer system's physical layout and properties such as flow velocity, the pathogen sampling procedure, and the model's boundary conditions. The methodology proposed and developed in this paper opens new possibilities for WBE, suggesting a rapid back-tracing of human-excreted biomarkers based on only sampling at the outlet or other key points, but would require high-frequency, contaminant-specific sensor systems that are not available currently.",other,Not specified

Timely detection of the tumor progression after treatment could improve the survival outcome of patients. This study aimed to develop machine learning models to predict events (defined as either (1) the first tumor relapse locally, regionally, or distantly; (2) a diagnosis of secondary malignant tumor; or (3) death because of any reason.) in BC patients post-treatment.
METHODS: The patients with the response of stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were selected. The clinicopathological features and the survival data were recorded in 1 year and 5 years, respectively. Patients were randomly divided into the training set and test set in the ratio of 8:2. A random forest (RF) and a logistic regression were established in both of 1-year cohort and the 5-year cohort. The performance was compared between the two models. The models were validated using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.
RESULTS: A total of 315 patients were included. In the 1-year cohort, 197 patients were divided into a training set while 87 were into a test set. The specificity, sensitivity, and AUC were 0.800, 0.833, and 0.810 in the RF model. And 0.520, 0.833, and 0.653 of the logistic regression. In the 5-year cohort, 132 patients were divided into the training set while 33 were into the test set. The specificity, sensitivity, and AUC were 0.882, 0.750, and 0.829 in the RF model.

The prodromal phase of AD is mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The capacity to predict the transitional phase from MCI to AD represents a challenge for the scientific community. The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is useful for diagnostic, predictive analysis starting from the clinical epidemiology of neurodegenerative disorders. We propose a Machine Learning Model (MLM) where the algorithms were trained on a set of neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and clinical data to predict the diagnosis of cognitive decline in both MCI and AD patients.
METHODS: We built a dataset with clinical and neuropsychological data of 4848 patients, of which 2156 had a diagnosis of AD, and 2684 of MCI, for the Machine Learning Model, and 60 patients were enrolled for the test dataset. We trained an ML algorithm using RoboMate software based on the training dataset, and then calculated its accuracy using the test dataset.
RESULTS: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that diagnostic accuracy was 86%, with an appropriate cutoff value of 1.5; sensitivity was 72%; and specificity reached a value of 91% for clinical data prediction with MMSE.
CONCLUSION: This method may support clinicians to provide a second opinion concerning high prognostic power in the progression of cognitive impairment. The MLM used in this study is based on big data that were confirmed in enrolled patients and given a credibility about the presence of determinant risk factors also supported by a cognitive test score.",other,Not specified

The process from air pollutant emission to individual exposure is however complex and nonlinear, which poses significant modeling challenges. This study aims to develop an exposure assessment model that can strike a balance between accuracy, complexity, and usability. In this regard, neural networks offer one possible approach. This study employed a custom-designed pruned feed-forward neural network (pruned-FNN) approach to calculate the air pollution exposure index based on emission time and rates, terrain factors, meteorological conditions, and proximity measurements. The model's performance was evaluated by cross-validating the estimated exposure indexes with ground-based monitoring records. The pruned FNN can predict pollution exposure indexes (PEIs) that are highly and stably correlated with the monitored air pollutant concentrations (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for tenfold cross-validation (mean ± standard deviation: 0.906 ± 0.028) and for random cross-validation (0.913 ± 0.024)). The predicted values are also close to the ground truth in most cases (95.5% of the predicted PEIs have relative errors smaller than 10%) when the training datasets are sufficiently large and well-covered. The pruned-FNN method can make accurate exposure estimations using a flexible number of variables and less extensive data in a less money/time-consuming manner. Compared to other exposure assessment models, the pruned FNN is an appropriate and effective approach for exposure assessment that covers a large geographic area over a long period of time.",other,Not specified

Further, missing data due to device malfunction, improper initialization, and/or the participant forgetting to wear one or both devices can complicate construction of daily behavioral compositions. The Method for Activity Sleep Harmonization (MASH) is a process that harmonizes data from two different devices using data from women who concurrently wore hip (waking) and wrist (sleep) devices for ≥ 4 days.
METHODS: MASH was developed using data from 1285 older community-dwelling women (ages: 60-72 years) who concurrently wore a hip-worn ActiGraph GT3X + accelerometer (waking activity) and a wrist-worn Actiwatch 2 device (sleep) for ≥ 4 days (N = 10,123 days) at the same time. MASH is a two-tiered process using (1) scored sleep data (from Actiwatch) or (2) one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN) to create predicted wake intervals, reconcile sleep and activity data disagreement, and create day-level night-day-night pairings. MASH chooses between two different 1D CNN models based on data availability (ActiGraph + Actiwatch or ActiGraph-only). MASH was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall curves and sleep-wake intervals are compared before (pre-harmonization) and after MASH application.
RESULTS: MASH 1D CNNs had excellent performance (ActiGraph + Actiwatch ROC-AUC = 0.991 and ActiGraph-only ROC-AUC = 0.983). After exclusions (partial wear [n = 1285], missing sleep data proceeding activity data [n = 269], and < 60 min sleep [n = 9]), 8560 days were used to show the utility of MASH. Of the 8560 days, 46.0% had ≥ 1-min disagreement between the devices or used the 1D CNN for sleep estimates. The MASH waking intervals were corrected (median minutes [IQR]: -27.0 [-115.0, 8.0]) relative to their pre-harmonization estimates. Most correction (-18.0 [-93.0, 2.0] minutes) was due to reducing sedentary behavior. The other waking behaviors were reduced a median (IQR) of -1.0 (-4.0, 1.0) minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing MASH to harmonize concurrently worn hip and wrist devices can minimizes data loss and correct for disagreement between devices, ultimately improving accuracy of 24-h compositions necessary for time-use epidemiology.",other,Not specified

ML is a powerful tool that has the potential to better prognosticate UPS.
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for cases of histologically confirmed undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) (n = 665). Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were recorded, and ML models were developed to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival. The best performing ML model was externally validated using an institutional cohort of UPS patients (n = 151).
RESULTS: All ML models performed best at the 1-year time point and worst at the 5-year time point. On internal validation within the SEER cohort, the best models had c-statistics of 0.67-0.69 at the 5-year time point. The Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) model was the best performing model and used for external validation. Similarly, the MLP model performed best at 1-year and worst at 5-year on external validation with c-statistics of 0.85 and 0.81, respectively. The MLP model was well calibrated on external validation. The MLP model has been made publicly available at https://rachar.shinyapps.io/ups_app/ .
CONCLUSION: Machine learning models perform well for survival prediction in UPS, though this sarcoma subtype may be more difficult to prognosticate than other subtypes. Future studies are needed to further validate the machine learning approach for UPS prognostication.",other,Not specified

Studies published from 2000 to 2023 employing machine learning for lung cancer survival prediction were included. Risk of bias assessment used the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool. Thirty studies were reviewed, with 13 (43.3%) using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database. Missing data handling was addressed in 12 (40%) studies, primarily through data transformation and conversion. Feature selection algorithms were used in 19 (63.3%) studies, with age, sex, and N stage being the most chosen features. Random forest was the predominant machine learning model, used in 17 (56.6%) studies. While the number of lung cancer survival prediction studies is limited, the use of machine learning models based on clinical data has grown since 2012. Consideration of diverse patient cohorts and data pre-processing are crucial. Notably, most studies did not account for missing data, normalization, scaling, or standardized data, potentially introducing bias. Therefore, a comprehensive study on lung cancer survival prediction using clinical data is needed, addressing these challenges.",other,Not specified

The difficulties lie in the uncertainties of the amount of virus shed by an infected individual to wastewater as documented in clinical studies. This situation is even worse considering the existence of a population of silent infections and many other confounding factors. In this research, a quantitative framework of a phenomenological neural network (PNN) was developed to compute silent infections. The PNN was trained using the WBE data from the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) - a program launched by the CDC of the United States in 2020. It is found that the PNN excelled with superior interpretability and reduced overfitting. A big-data perspective on virus shedding by an infected population revealed more deterministic virus-shedding dynamics compared to the clinical studies perspective on virus shedding by an infected individual. With such characteristics employed as the theoretical basis for the estimation of the silent infections, a ratio of silent to reported infections was found to be 5.7 as the national median during the studied period. The study also noted the influence of temperature, sewershed population, and per-capita flow rates on the computation of silent infections. It is expected that the proposed framework in this work would facilitate public health actions guided by the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. In case of a new wave emergence or a new virus disease outbreak like COVID-19, the PNN powered by the NWSS would outline consolidated and systematic information that would enable rapid deployment of public health actions.",other,Not specified

Individual NPC patients may attain different outcomes. This study aims to build a prognostic system by combining a highly accurate machine learning model (ML) model with explainable artificial intelligence to stratify NPC patients into low and high chance of survival groups. Explainability is provided using Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) techniques. A total of 1094 NPC patients were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for model training and internal validation. We combined five different ML algorithms to form a uniquely stacked algorithm. The predictive performance of the stacked algorithm was compared with a state-of-the-art algorithm-extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to stratify the NPC patients into chance of survival groups. We validated our model with temporal validation (n = 547) and geographic external validation (Helsinki University Hospital NPC cohort, n = 60). The developed stacked predictive ML model showed an accuracy of 85.9% while the XGBoost had 84.5% after the training and testing phases. This demonstrated that both XGBoost and the stacked model showed comparable performance. External geographic validation of XGBoost model showed a c-index of 0.74, accuracy of 76.7%, and area under curve of 0.76. The SHAP technique revealed that age of the patient at diagnosis, T-stage, ethnicity, M-stage, marital status, and grade were among the prominent input variables in decreasing order of significance for the overall survival of NPC patients. LIME showed the degree of reliability of the prediction made by the model. In addition, both techniques showed how each feature contributed to the prediction made by the model. LIME and SHAP techniques provided personalized protective and risk factors for each NPC patient and unraveled some novel non-linear relationships between input features and survival chance. The examined ML approach showed the ability to predict the chance of overall survival of NPC patients. This is important for effective treatment planning care and informed clinical decisions. To enhance outcome results, including survival in NPC, ML may aid in planning individualized therapy for this patient population.",other,Not specified

We therefore aimed to develop an accurate GFR-estimating tool for this age group.
METHODS: Adults aged ≥ 65 years who underwent GFR measurement by technetium-99 m-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) renal dynamic imaging were included. Data were randomly split into a training set containing 80% of the participants and a test set containing the remaining 20% of the subjects. The Back propagation neural network (BPNN) approach was used to derive a novel GFR estimation tool; then we compared the performance of the BPNN tool with six creatinine-based equations (Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI], European Kidney Function Consortium [EKFC], Berlin Initiative Study-1 [BIS1], Lund-Malmö Revised [LMR], Asian modified CKD-EPI, and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD]) in the test cohort. Three equation performance criteria were considered: bias (difference between measured GFR and estimated GFR), precision (interquartile range [IQR] of the median difference), and accuracy P30 (percentage of GFR estimates that are within 30% of measured GFR).
RESULTS: The study included 1,222 older adults. The mean age of both the training cohort (n = 978) and the test cohort (n = 244) was 72 ± 6 years, with 544 (55.6%) and 129 (52.9%) males, respectively. The median bias of BPNN was 2.06 ml/min/1.73 m2, which was smaller than that of LMR (4.59 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.03), and higher than that of the Asian modified CKD-EPI (-1.43 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.02). The median bias between BPNN and each of CKD-EPI (2.19 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.31), EKFC (-1.41 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.26), BIS1 (0.64 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.99), and MDRD (1.11 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.45) was not significant. However, the BPNN had the highest precision IQR (14.31 ml/min/1.73 m2) and the greatest accuracy P30 among all equations (78.28%). At measured GFR &lt; 45 ml/min/1.73 m2, the BPNN has highest accuracy P30 (70.69%), and highest precision IQR (12.46 ml/min/1.73 m2). The biases of BPNN and BIS1 equations were similar (0.74 [-1.55-2.78] and 0.24 [-2.58-1.61], respectively), smaller than any other equation.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel BPNN tool is more accurate than the currently available creatinine-based GFR estimation equations in an older population and could be recommended for routine clinical use.",other,Not specified

Herein, we detail the development and application of a hierarchical machine learning model to rapidly identify and trace the geographical source of S. Enteritidis infections from whole genome sequencing data. 2313 S. Enteritidis genomes, collected by the UKHSA between 2014-2019, were used to train a 'local classifier per node' hierarchical classifier to attribute isolates to four continents, 11 sub-regions, and 38 countries (53 classes). The highest classification accuracy was achieved at the continental level followed by the sub-regional and country levels (macro F1: 0.954, 0.718, 0.661, respectively). A number of countries commonly visited by UK travelers were predicted with high accuracy (hF1: &gt;0.9). Longitudinal analysis and validation with publicly accessible international samples indicated that predictions were robust to prospective external datasets.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a predictive model for DM in stage T1 GC using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Patients with stage T1 GC from 2010 to 2017 were screened from the public Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Meanwhile, we collected patients with stage T1 GC admitted to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from 2015 to 2017. We applied seven ML algorithms: logistic regression, random forest (RF), LASSO, support vector machine, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayesian Model, Artificial Neural Network. Finally, a RF model for DM of T1 GC was developed. The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and accuracy were used to evaluate and compare the predictive performance of the RF model with other models. Finally, we performed a prognostic analysis of patients who developed distant metastases. Independent risk factors for prognosis were analysed by univariate and multifactorial regression. K-M curves were used to express differences in survival prognosis for each variable and subvariable. A total of 2698 cases were included in the SEER dataset, 314 with DM, and 107 hospital patients were included, 14 with DM.

Factors such as the most common symptoms and severity of infection, the circulation of different variants, the preparedness of health services, and control efforts based on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions played important roles in the disease incidence. The constant evolution and changes require the continuous mapping and assessing of epidemiological features based on time-series forecasting. Nonetheless, it is necessary to identify the events, patterns, and actions that were potential factors that affected daily COVID-19 cases. In this work, we analyzed several databases, including information on social mobility, epidemiological reports, and mass population testing, to identify patterns of reported cases and events that may indicate changes in COVID-19 behavior in the city of Araraquara, Brazil. In our analysis, we used a mathematical approach with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to map possible events and machine learning model approaches such as Seasonal Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and neural networks (NNs) for data interpretation and temporal prospecting. Our results showed a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of about 5 (more precisely, a 4.55 error over 71 cases for 20 March 2021 and a 5.57 error over 106 cases for 3 June 2021). These results demonstrated that FFT is a useful tool for supporting the development of the best prevention and control measures for COVID-19.",other,Not specified

METHODS: We extracted a cohort of 124,770 patients with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and enrolled a cohort of 1897 patients who were diagnosed as having bone metastases. Patients with a survival time of 3 months or less were considered to have had early death. To compare patients with and without early mortality, subgroup analysis was used. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: a training cohort (n = 1509, 80%) and an internal testing cohort (n = 388, 20%). In the training cohort, five machine learning techniques were employed to train and optimize models for predicting early mortality, and an ensemble machine learning technique was used to generate risk probability in a way of soft voting, and it was able to combine the results from the multiply machine learning algorithms. The study employed both internal and external validations, and the key performance indicators included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), Brier score, and calibration curve. Patients from two tertiary hospitals were chosen as the external testing cohorts (n = 98). Feature importance and reclassification were both operated in the study.
RESULTS: The early mortality was 55.5% (1052/1897). Eleven clinical characteristics were included as input features of machine learning models: sex (p = 0.019), marital status (p = 0.004), tumor stage (p = 0.025), node stage (p = 0.001), fibrosis score (p = 0.040), AFP level (p = 0.032), tumor size (p = 0.001), lung metastases (p < 0.001), cancer-directed surgery (p < 0.001), radiation (p < 0.001), and chemotherapy (p < 0.001). Application of the ensemble model in the internal testing population yielded an AUROC of 0.779 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.727-0.820), which was the largest AUROC among all models. Additionally, the ensemble model (0.191) outperformed the other five machine learning models in terms of Brier score. In terms of decision curves, the ensemble model also showed favorable clinical usefulness. External validation showed similar results; with an AUROC of 0.764 and Brier score of 0.195, the prediction performance was further improved after revision of the model. Feature importance demonstrated that the top three most crucial features were chemotherapy, radiation, and lung metastases based on the ensemble model. Reclassification of patients revealed a substantial difference in the two risk groups' actual probabilities of early mortality (74.38% vs. 31.35%, p < 0.001). Patients in the high-risk group had significantly shorter survival time than patients in the low-risk group (p < 0.001), according to the Kaplan-Meier survival curve.
CONCLUSIONS: The ensemble machine learning model exhibits promising prediction performance for early mortality among HCC patients with bone metastases. With the aid of routinely accessible clinical characteristics, this model can be a trustworthy prognostic tool to predict the early death of those patients and facilitate clinical decision-making.",other,Not specified

However, they often contain a potentially large number of free parameters whose values cannot be obtained from theory but need to be inferred from data. This is especially the case for models in the social sciences, economics, or computational epidemiology. Yet, many current parameter estimation methods are mathematically involved and computationally slow to run. In this paper, we present a computationally simple and fast method to retrieve accurate probability densities for model parameters using neural differential equations. We present a pipeline comprising multiagent models acting as forward solvers for systems of ordinary or stochastic differential equations and a neural network to then extract parameters from the data generated by the model. The two combined create a powerful tool that can quickly estimate densities on model parameters, even for very large systems. We demonstrate the method on synthetic time series data of the SIR model of the spread of infection and perform an in-depth analysis of the Harris-Wilson model of economic activity on a network, representing a nonconvex problem. For the latter, we apply our method both to synthetic data and to data of economic activity across Greater London. We find that our method calibrates the model orders of magnitude more accurately than a previous study of the same dataset using classical techniques, while running between 195 and 390 times faster.",other,Not specified

METHODS: Patients who diagnosed with NSCLC between 2010 and 2018 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database were involved. To increase the extensibility of the research, data of patients who first diagnosed with NSCLC at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University between January 2007 and December 2016 were also included in this study. Independent risk factors for BM in NSCLC were screened by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. At this basis, we chose six commonly machine learning algorithms to build predictive models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Decision tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Naive Bayes classifiers (NBC) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB). Then, the best model was identified to build the web-predictor for predicting BM of NSCLC patients. Finally, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate the performance of these models.
RESULTS: A total of 50581 NSCLC patients were included in this study, and 5087(10.06%) of them developed BM. The sex, grade, laterality, histology, T stage, N stage, and chemotherapy were independent risk factors for NSCLC. Of these six models, the machine learning model built by the XGB algorithm performed best in both internal and external data setting validation, with AUC scores of 0.808 and 0.841, respectively. Then, the XGB algorithm was used to build a web predictor of BM from NSCLC.

It is important to identify patients at high risk so that doctors can adopt more aggressive regimens to treat their condition. Machine learning has the advantage of processing complicated data. To date, there is no research that tries to use machine learning algorithms and big data to construct prognostic models for ACC patients.
METHODS: Clinical data of patients with ACC were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. These records were screened according to preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. The remaining data were applied to univariate survival analysis to select meaningful outcome-related candidates. Backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and naive Bayes classifier (NBC) were chosen as alternative algorithms. The acquired cases were grouped into a training set and a test set at a ratio of 8:2, and a 10-fold cross-validation method repeated 10 times was performed. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves were used as indices of efficiency.
RESULTS: The calculated 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates were 62.3%, 42.0%, 34.9%, and 26.1%, respectively. A total of 825 patients were included in the study. In the training set, the AUCs of BP-ANN, RF, SVM, and NBC for predicting 1-year survival status were 0.921, 0.885, 0.865, and 0.854; those for predicting 3-year survival status were 0.859, 0.865, 0.837, and 0.831; and those for 5-year survival status were 0.888, 0.872, 0.852, and 0.841, respectively. In the test set, AUCs of these four models for 1-year survival status were 0.899, 0.875, 0.886, and 0.862; those for 3-year survival status were 0.871, 0.858, 0.853, and 0.869; and those for 5-year survival status were 0.841, 0.783, 0.836, and 0.867, respectively.

This study aimed to develop and validate a clinical prediction model based on machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of liver metastasis in patients with rectal cancer.
METHODS: We integrated two rectal cancer cohorts from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Chinese multicenter hospitals from 2010-2017. We also built and validated liver metastasis prediction models for rectal cancer using six machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), light gradient boosting (LGBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression (LR), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The models were evaluated by combining several metrics, such as the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy score, sensitivity, specificity and F1 score. Finally, we created a network calculator using the best model.
RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 19,958 patients from the SEER database and 924 patients from two hospitals in China. The AUC values of the six prediction models ranged from 0.70 to 0.95. The XGB model showed the best predictive power, with the following metrics assessed in the internal test set: AUC (0.918), accuracy (0.884), sensitivity (0.721), and specificity (0.787).

The present study aimed to provide insights into the epidemiology of brucellosis and compare the performance of some prediction models using surveillance data from Tebessa province, Algeria.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study.
METHODS: Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), neural network autoregressive (NNAR), and hybrid SARIMA-NNAR models were developed to predict monthly brucellosis notifications. The prediction performance of these models was compared using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
RESULTS: Overall, 13 670 human brucellosis cases were notified in Tebessa province from 2000-2020 with a male-to-female ratio of 1.3. The most affected age group was 15-44 years (56.2%). The cases were reported throughout the year with manifest seasonality. The annual notification rate ranged from 30.9 (2013) to 246.7 (2005) per 100 000 inhabitants. The disease was not evenly distributed, rather spatial and temporal variability was observed. The SARIMA (2,1,3) (1,1,1)12, NNAR (12,1,6)12, and SARIMA (2,0,2) (1,1,0)12-NNAR (5,1,4)12 were selected as the best-fitting models. The RMSE, MAE, and MAPE of the SARIMA and SARIMA-NNAR models were by far lower than those of the NNAR model. Moreover, the SARIMA-NNNAR hybrid model achieved a slightly better prediction accuracy for 2020 than the SARIMA model.
CONCLUSION: As evidenced by the obtained results, both SARIMA and hybrid SARIMA-NNAR models are suitable to predict human brucellosis cases with high accuracy. Reasonable predictions, along with mapping brucellosis incidence, could be of great help to veterinary and health policymakers in the development of informed, effective, and targeted policies, as well as timely interventions.",other,Not specified

Our retrospective study aims to provide a reliable machine learning-based model to predict the occurrence of LNM in kidney cancer. We screened the pathological grade, liver metastasis, M staging, primary site, T staging, and tumor size from the training group (n=39016) formed by the SEER database and the validation group (n=771) formed by the medical center. Independent predictors of LNM in cancer patients. Using six different algorithms to build a prediction model, it is found that the prediction performance of the XGB model in the training group and the validation group is significantly better than any other machine learning model. The results show that prediction tools based on machine learning can accurately predict the probability of LNM in patients with kidney cancer and have satisfactory clinical application prospects.
BACKGROUND: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is associated with the prognosis of patients with kidney cancer. This study aimed to provide reliable machine learning-based (ML-based) models to predict the probability of LNM in kidney cancer.
METHODS: Data on patients diagnosed with kidney cancer were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Outcomes (SEER) database from 2010 to 2017, and variables were filtered by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Statistically significant risk factors were used to build predictive models. We used 10-fold cross-validation in the validation of the model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the model. Correlation heat maps were used to investigate the correlation of features using permutation analysis to assess the importance of predictors. Probability density functions (PDFs) and clinical utility curves (CUCs) were used to determine clinical utility thresholds.
RESULTS: The training cohort of this study included 39,016 patients, and the validation cohort included 771 patients. In the two cohorts, 2544 (6.5%) and 66 (8.1%) patients had LNM, respectively. Pathological grade, liver metastasis, M stage, primary site, T stage, and tumor size were independent predictive factors of LNM. In both model validation, the XGB model significantly outperformed any of the machine learning models with an AUC value of 0.916.A web calculator (https://share.streamlit.io/liuwencai4/renal_lnm/main/renal_lnm.py) were built based on the XGB model. Based on the PDF and CUC, we suggested 54.6% as a threshold probability for guiding the diagnosis of LNM, which could distinguish about 89% of LNM patients.

In such analysis, (semi)parametric models, such as the Cox Proportional Hazards model, have been routinely adopted. In recent years, deep neural network (DNN) has been shown to excel in many fields with its flexibility and superior prediction performance, and it has been applied to the analysis of cancer survival data. Cancer registry data usually has a broad spatial and temporal coverage, leading to significant heterogeneity. Published studies have suggested that it is not sensible to fit one model for all spatial and temporal locations combined. On the other hand, it is inefficient to fit one model for each spatial/temporal location separately. Motivated by such considerations, in this study, we develop a spatio-temporally smoothed DNN approach for the analysis of cancer registry data with a (censored) survival outcome. This approach can accommodate the significant differences across time and space, while recognizing that the spatial and temporal changes are smooth. It is effectively realized via cutting-edge optimization techniques. To draw more definitive conclusions, we also develop an approach for assessing the importance of each individual input variable. Data on head and neck cancer (HNC) and pancreatic cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database is analyzed. Compared to direct competitors, the proposed approach leads to network architectures that are smoother. Evaluated using the time-dependent Concordance-Index, it has a better prediction performance. The important variables are also biomedically sensible. Overall, this study can deliver a new and effective tool for deciphering cancer survival at the population level.",other,Not specified

The mortality of HCC patients with lung metastasis was 51.65% within 1 month. The screened prognostic factors (age, N stage, T stage, tumor size, surgery, grade, radiation, and chemotherapy) and gender were used to construct prediction models. The area under curve (0.853 vs. 0.771) of random forest model was more optimized than that of logistic regression model in the training set. But, there were no significant differences in testing and validation sets between random forest and logistic regression models. The value of area under curve in the logistic regression model was significantly higher than that of the broad learning system model (0.763 vs. 0.745), support vector machine model (0.763 vs. 0.689) in the validation set, and higher than that of the naïve Bayes model (0.775 vs. 0.744) in the testing model.

Uptake of [99m Tc]Tc-DMSA has been shown to correlate with glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radiopharmaceuticals used for positron emission tomography (PET) show high renal uptake and are being investigated for renal imaging. [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET parameters have been shown to correlate with estimated GFR (eGFR). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between renal [18 F]PSMA-1007 uptake and eGFR.
METHODS: Hundred and eighty-five patients underwent PET imaging at 1 and 2 h after injection of 4.0 ± 0.2 MBq [18 F]PSMA-1007. Serum creatinine levels were measured and GFR estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equations. Fifteen patients were excluded due to missing or incorrect data. Thus, data from 170 patients were analyzed. Kidneys were segmented in the PET images using a convolutional neural network with manual correction. For each kidney, mean standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>mean</sub> ) and segmentation volume in millilitres were measured. Linear regression analyses were performed with eGFR as the outcome variable.
RESULTS: Variation in the eGFR values was explained to a significant degree by SUV<sub>mean</sub> and renal segmentation volume in both the 1 and 2 h images. This correlation was stronger for CKD-EPI eGFR (1 h R2  = 0.64; 2 h R2  = 0.64) than for MDRD eGFR (1 h R2  = 0.47; 2 h R2  = 0.45).

As a result, it is critical to understand and collect primary data on the virus, infection epidemiology, and treatment. Despite the speed with which the virus was detected, studies of its cell biology and architecture at the ultrastructural level are still in their infancy. Therefore, we investigated and analyzed the viral morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 to extract important key points of the virus's characteristics. Then, we proposed a prediction model to identify the real virus levels based on the optimization of a full recurrent neural network (RNN) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Consequently, identification of virus levels depends on the size of the morphometry of the area (width, height, circularity, roundness, aspect ratio, and solidity).

To tackle above issues, we proposed a novel scheme to estimate daily O<sub>3</sub> concentrations on a fine grid scale (1 km × 1 km) from 2018 to 2020 across China based on machine learning methods using hourly observed ground-level pollutant concentrations data, meteorological data, satellite data, and auxiliary data including digital elevation model (DEM), land use data (LUD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population (POP), and nighttime light images (NTL), and to identify the difference of influential factors of O<sub>3</sub> on diverse urbanization and topography conditions. Some findings were achieved. The correlation coefficients (R2) between O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and surface net solar radiation (SNSR), boundary layer height (BLH), 2 m temperature (T2M), 10 m v-component (MVW), and NDVI were 0.80, 0.40, 0.35, 0.30, and 0.20, respectively. The random forest (RF) demonstrated the highest validation R2 (0.86) and lowest validation RMSE (13.74 μg/m3) in estimating O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, followed by support vector machine (SVM) (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 18.39 μg/m3), backpropagation neural network (BP) (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 19.26 μg/m3), and multiple linear regression (MLR) (R2 = 0.52, RMSE = 25.99 μg/m3). Our China High-Resolution O<sub>3</sub> Dataset (CHROD) exhibited an acceptable accuracy at different spatial-temporal scales. Additionally, O<sub>3</sub> concentrations showed decreasing trend and represented obviously spatiotemporal heterogeneity across China from 2018 to 2020. Overall, O<sub>3</sub> was mainly affected by human activities in higher urbanization regions, while O<sub>3</sub> was mainly controlled by meteorological factors, vegetation coverage, and elevation in lower urbanization regions. The scheme of this study is useful and valuable in understanding the mechanism of O<sub>3</sub> formation and improving the quality of the O<sub>3</sub> dataset.",other,Not specified

The objectives of this study were to determine trends and significant change points, and to forecast the number of LSD outbreak reports in Africa, Europe, and Asia. LSD outbreak report data (January 2005 to January 2022) from the World Organization for Animal Health were analyzed. We determined statistically significant change points in the data using binary segmentation, and forecast the number of LSD reports using auto-regressive moving average (ARIMA) and neural network auto-regressive (NNAR) models. Four significant change points were identified for each continent. The year between the third and fourth change points (2016-2019) in the African data was the period with the highest mean of number of LSD reports. All change points of LSD outbreaks in Europe corresponded with massive outbreaks during 2015-2017. Asia had the highest number of LSD reports in 2019 after the third detected change point in 2018. For the next three years (2022-2024), both ARIMA and NNAR forecast a rise in the number of LSD reports in Africa and a steady number in Europe. However, ARIMA predicts a stable number of outbreaks in Asia, whereas NNAR predicts an increase in 2023-2024.

Epub 2022 Oct 13.,Alabi RO,Int J Med Inform,2022,2022/10/24,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2022.104896,"BACKGROUND: The optimal management of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) includes both surgical and non-surgical, that is, (chemo)radiotherapy treatment options and their combinations. These approaches carry a risk of specific treatment-related side effects. HPV-positive OPSCC has been reported to be more sensitive to (chemo)radiotherapy-based treatment modalities.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to demonstrate how machine learning can aid in classifying OPSCC patients into risk groups (low-chance or high-chance) for overall survival. We examined the input variables using permutation feature importance. Furthermore, we provided explanations and interpretations using the Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) frameworks.
METHODS: The machine learning model for 3164 OPSCC patients was built using data obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database. A total of five variants of tree-based machine learning algorithms (voting ensemble, light GBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Extreme Random Trees) were used to divide the patients into risk groups. The developed model with the best predictive performance was temporally validated with a different cohort.
RESULTS: The voting ensemble machine learning algorithm showed an accuracy of 88.3%, Mathews' correlation coefficient of 0.72, and weighted area under curve of 0.93, when temporally validated. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status, age of the patients, T stage, marital status, N stage, and the treatment modality (surgery with postoperative radiotherapy) were found to have the most significant effects on the ability of the machine learning model to predict overall survival. Similarly, for the individual patients with SHAP framework, HPV status, gender, and treatment modality (surgery with postoperative radiotherapy) were the input features that improved the model's prediction.
CONCLUSION: The proposed stratification of OPSCC patients into risk groups by machine learning techniques can provide accurate predictions and thus aid clinicians in administering early and personalized interventions. Clinicians could utilize the predicted risk with the explanations offered by the SHAP and LIME frameworks to understand previously undetected relationships between prognostic variables to make informed clinical decisions and effective interventions.",other,Not specified

Whether CNNs could inform the epidemiology of COVID-19 classifying street images according to COVID-19 risk is unknown, yet it could pinpoint high-risk places and relevant features of the built environment. In a feasibility study, we trained CNNs to classify the area surrounding bus stops (Lima, Peru) into moderate or extreme COVID-19 risk.
DESIGN: CNN analysis based on images from bus stops and the surrounding area. We used transfer learning and updated the output layer of five CNNs: NASNetLarge, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, ResNet152V2 and ResNet101V2. We chose the best performing CNN, which was further tuned. We used GradCam to understand the classification process.
SETTING: Bus stops from Lima, Peru. We used five images per bus stop.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Bus stop images were classified according to COVID-19 risk into two labels: moderate or extreme.
RESULTS: NASNetLarge outperformed the other CNNs except in the recall metric for the moderate label and in the precision metric for the extreme label; the ResNet152V2 performed better in these two metrics (85% vs 76% and 63% vs 60%, respectively). The NASNetLarge was further tuned. The best recall (75%) and F1 score (65%) for the extreme label were reached with data augmentation techniques. Areas close to buildings or with people were often classified as extreme risk.
CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study showed that CNNs have the potential to classify street images according to levels of COVID-19 risk. In addition to applications in clinical medicine, CNNs and street images could advance the epidemiology of COVID-19 at the population level.",other,Not specified

METHODS: In total, 4039 patients diagnosed with OPSCC between 2004 and 2016 were enrolled in this study. In particular, 13 variables were selected and analyzed: age, sex, tumor grade, tumor size, neck dissection, radiation therapy, cancer directed surgery, chemotherapy, T stage, N stage, M stage, clinical stage, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status. The T-, N-, and clinical staging were reconstructed based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual, 8th Edition. The patients were randomly assigned to a development or test dataset at a 7:3 ratio. The extremely randomized survival tree (EST), conditional survival forest (CSF), and DeepSurv models were used to predict the overall and disease-specific survival in patients with OPSCC. A 10-fold cross-validation on a development dataset was used to build the training and internal validation data for all models. We evaluated the predictive performance of each model using test datasets.
RESULTS: A higher c-index value and lower integrated Brier score (IBS), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) indicate a better performance from a machine learning model. The C-index was the highest for the DeepSurv model (0.77). The IBS was also the lowest in the DeepSurv model (0.08). However, the RMSE and RAE were the lowest for the CSF model.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated various machine-learning-based survival prediction models. The CSF model showed a better performance in predicting the survival of patients with OPSCC in terms of the RMSE and RAE. In this context, machine learning models based on personalized survival predictions can be used to stratify various complex risk factors. This could help in designing personalized treatments and predicting prognoses for patients.",other,Not specified

This study uses machine learning algorithms to create a predictive tool for maternal and newborn healthcare providers' perception of being safe in the workplace globally during the pandemic.
METHODS: We used data collected between 24 March and 5 July 2020 through a global online survey of maternal and newborn healthcare providers. The questionnaire was available in 12 languages. To predict healthcare providers' perception of safety in the workplace, we used features collected in the questionnaire, in addition to publicly available national economic and COVID-19-related factors. We built, trained and tested five machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, CatBoost and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification and regression. We extracted from RF models the relative contribution of features in output prediction.
RESULTS: Models included data from 941 maternal and newborn healthcare providers from 89 countries. ML models performed well in classification and regression tasks, whereby RF had 82% cross-validated accuracy for classification, and CatBoost with 0.46 cross-validated root mean square error for regression. In both classification and regression, the most important features contributing to output prediction were classified as three themes: (1) information accessibility, clarity and quality; (2) availability of support and means of protection; and (3) COVID-19 epidemiology.
CONCLUSION: This study identified salient features contributing to maternal and newborn healthcare providers perception of safety in the workplace. The developed tool can be used by health systems globally to allow real-time learning from data collected during a health system shock. By responding in real-time to the needs of healthcare providers, health systems could prevent potential negative consequences on the quality of care offered to women and newborns.",other,Not specified

The World Health Organization aims to halve this burden by 2030. To achieve this ambitious goal, we need to close the data gap in snake ecology and snakebite epidemiology and give healthcare providers up-to-date knowledge and access to better diagnostic tools. An essential first step is to improve the capacity to identify biting snakes taxonomically. The existence of AI-based identification tools for other animals offers an innovative opportunity to apply machine learning to snake identification and snakebite envenoming, a life-threatening situation.
METHODOLOGY: We developed an AI model based on Vision Transformer, a recent neural network architecture, and a comprehensive snake photo dataset of 386,006 training photos covering 198 venomous and 574 non-venomous snake species from 188 countries. We gathered photos from online biodiversity platforms (iNaturalist and HerpMapper) and a photo-sharing site (Flickr).
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The model macro-averaged F1 score, which reflects the species-wise performance as averaging performance for each species, is 92.2%. The accuracy on a species and genus level is 96.0% and 99.0%, respectively. The average accuracy per country is 94.2%. The model accurately classifies selected venomous and non-venomous lookalike species from Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this model's taxonomic and geographic coverage and performance are unprecedented.

METHOD: All mEAC patients pathologically diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2018 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A 1:4 propensity score-matched analysis and a multivariate Cox analysis were performed to verify the prognostic value of surgical treatment modality. To identify suitable candidates, a machine learning model, classification and regression tree (CART), was constructed, and its predictive performance was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Of 4520 mEAC patients, 2901 (64.2%) were aged over 60 years and 4012 (88.8%) were males. There were 411 (9.1%) patients receiving surgical treatment modality. In the propensity score-matched analysis, surgical treatment modality was significantly associated with a decreased risk of death (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.40-0.55); surgical patients had almost twice as much median survival time (MST) as those without resection (MST with 95% CI: 23 [17-27] months vs. 11 [11-12] months, P &lt;0.0001). The similar association was also observed in the multivariate Cox analysis (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.41-0.53). Then, a CART was constructed to identify suitable candidates for surgical treatment modality, with a relatively good discrimination ability (AUC with 95% CI: 0.710 [0.648-0.771]).
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment modality may be a promising strategy to prolong survival of mEAC patients. The CART in our study could serve as a useful tool to predict suitable candidates for surgical treatment modality.

Approximately 70% of cases are localized at diagnosis, and 30% are metastatic. Most localized kidney cancers can be cured by surgery, but most metastatic patients relapse after surgery and eventually die of kidney cancer. Therefore, accurately predicting patient survival and identifying high-risk metastatic patients will effectively guide interventions and improve prognosis.
METHODS: This study used the data of 12,394 kidney cancer patients from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database to construct a research cohort related to kidney cancer survival and metastasis. Eight machine learning models (including support vector machines, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, K-nearest neighbors, and multilayer perceptron) were developed to predict the survival and metastasis of kidney cancer and six evaluation indicators (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC]) were used to verify, evaluate, and optimize the models.
RESULTS: Among the eight machine learning models, Logistic Regression has the highest AUROC in both prediction scenarios. For 3-year survival prediction, the Logistic Regression model had an accuracy of 0.684, a sensitivity of 0.702, a specificity of 0.670, a precision of 0.686, an F1 score of 0.683, and an AUROC of 0.741.

Efforts to quantify injury probability utilizing machine learning have been met with renewed interest, and the development of effective models has the potential to supplement the decision-making process of team physicians.
PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to (1) characterize the epidemiology of time-loss lower extremity muscle strains (LEMSs) in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1999 to 2019 and (2) determine the validity of a machine-learning model in predicting injury risk. It was hypothesized that time-loss LEMSs would be infrequent in this cohort and that a machine-learning model would outperform conventional methods in the prediction of injury risk.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: Performance data and rates of the 4 major muscle strain injury types (hamstring, quadriceps, calf, and groin) were compiled from the 1999 to 2019 NBA seasons. Injuries included all publicly reported injuries that resulted in lost playing time. Models to predict the occurrence of a LEMS were generated using random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural network, support vector machines, elastic net penalized logistic regression, and generalized logistic regression. Performance was compared utilizing discrimination, calibration, decision curve analysis, and the Brier score.
RESULTS: A total of 736 LEMSs resulting in lost playing time occurred among 2103 athletes. Important variables for predicting LEMS included previous number of lower extremity injuries; age; recent history of injuries to the ankle, hamstring, or groin; and recent history of concussion as well as 3-point attempt rate and free throw attempt rate. The XGBoost machine achieved the best performance based on discrimination assessed via internal validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.840), calibration, and decision curve analysis.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost outperformed logistic regression in the prediction of a LEMS that will result in lost time. Several variables increased the risk of LEMS, including a history of various lower extremity injuries, recent concussion, and total number of previous injuries.",other,Not specified

The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm model to predict the risk of patients with GCTC developing the M1b stage, which can be used to assist in early intervention of patients.
METHODS: The clinical and pathological data of patients with GCTC were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Combing the patient's characteristic variables, we applied six machine learning (ML) algorithms to develop the predictive models, including logistic regression(LR), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightGBM), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN). Model performances were evaluated by 10-fold cross-receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of models for predictive accuracy. A total of 54 patients from our own center (October 2006 to June 2021) were collected as the external validation cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 4,323 patients eligible for inclusion were screened for enrollment from the SEER database, of which 178 (4.12%) developing M1b stage. Multivariate logistic regression showed that lymph node dissection (LND), T stage, N stage, lung metastases, and distant lymph node metastases were the independent predictors of developing M1b stage risk. The models based on both the XGBoost and RF algorithms showed stable and efficient prediction performance in the training and external validation groups.
CONCLUSION: S-stage is not an independent factor for predicting the risk of developing the M1b stage of patients with GCTC. The ML models based on both XGBoost and RF algorithms have high predictive effectiveness and may be used to predict the risk of developing the M1b stage of patients with GCTC, which is of promising value in clinical decision-making. Models still need to be tested with a larger sample of real-world data.",transformer/generative,Not specified

RESULT: Through experimental analysis, 67 potential biomarkers were extracted, comprising 49 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated genes, using statistical techniques and a set-theory consensus strategy. We trained the machine learning models on 12 different biomarker sets and found that the SVM model performed better than the other classifiers with 99.07% classification accuracy for moderate DEGs.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that identified differentially expressed genes of the moderate DEGs biomarker set, |log2FC| ≥ 2 with adjusted p-value < 0.05, work significantly as input features to implement a machine learning model using a kernel-based SVM technique to predict COVID-19.",other,Not specified

With more and more research has been conducted on neural networks, we have a better understanding of the statistical proprieties of neural networks. While many studies focus on bounding the prediction error of neural network estimators, limited research has been done on the statistical inference of neural networks. From a statistical point of view, it is of great interest to investigate the statistical inference of neural networks as it could facilitate hypothesis testing in many fields (e.g., genetics, epidemiology, and medical science). In this paper, we propose a goodness-of-fit test statistic based on neural network sieve estimators. The test statistic follows an asymptotic distribution, which makes it easy to use in practice. We have also verified the theoretical asymptotic results via simulation studies and a real data application.",other,Not specified

METHODS: A total of 62,151 patients who diagnosed as LC without data missing between 2010 and 2015 were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The ANN model was trained and tested on an 75/25 split of the dataset. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity were used to evaluate and compare the ANN model with the random forest model.
RESULTS: For distant metastasis in the whole cohort, the ANN model had metrics AUC = 0.759, accuracy = 0.669, sensitivity = 0.906, and specificity = 0.613, which was better than the random forest model. For organ-specific metastasis in the cohort with distant metastasis, the sensitivity in bone metastasis, brain metastasis and liver metastasis were 0.913, 0.906 and 0.925, respectively. The most important variable was separate tumor nodules with 100% importance. The second important variable was visceral pleural invasion for distant metastasis, while histology for organ-specific metastasis.

This study was to assess various prediction models to evaluate the risk of LM based on machine learning algorithms.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinicopathological characteristics of PC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 2010 to 2018. The logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting, support vector, random forest (RF), and deep neural network machine algorithms were used to establish models to predict the risk of LM in PC patients. Specificity, sensitivity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the discriminatory capacity of the prediction models.
RESULTS: A total of 47,919 PC patients were identified; 15,909 (33.2%) of which developed LM. After iterative filtering, a total of nine features were included to establish the risk model for LM based on machine learning. The RF showed the most promising results in the prediction of complications among the models (ROC 0.871 for training and 0.832 for test sets). In risk stratification analysis, the LM rate and 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) in the high-risk group were worse than those in the intermediate- and low-risk groups.

This study aimed to develop and validate a clinical prediction model to predict the risk of lung metastasis among osteosarcoma patients based on machine learning (ML) algorithms.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected osteosarcoma patients from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database and from four hospitals in China. Six ML algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were applied to build predictive models for predicting lung metastasis using patient's demographics, clinical characteristics, and therapeutic variables from the SEER database. The model was internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation to calculate the mean area under the curve (AUC) and the model was externally validated using the Chinese multicenter osteosarcoma data. Relative importance ranking of predictors was plotted to understand the importance of each predictor in different ML algorithms. The correlation heat map of predictors was plotted to understand the correlation of each predictor, selecting the 10-fold cross-validation with the highest AUC value in the external validation ROC curve to build a web calculator.
RESULTS: Of all enrolled patients from the SEER database, 17.73% (194/1094) developed lung metastasis. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that sex, N stage, T stage, surgery, and bone metastasis were all independent risk factors for lung metastasis. In predicting lung metastasis, the mean AUCs of the six ML algorithms ranged from 0.711 to 0.738 in internal validation and 0.697 to 0.729 in external validation. Among the six ML algorithms, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model had the highest AUC value with an average internal AUC of 0.738 and an external AUC of 0.729. The best performing ML algorithm model was used to build a web calculator to facilitate clinicians to calculate the risk of lung metastasis for each patient.

However, viral concentrations or loads in wastewater often correlate poorly with clinical case numbers. To date, there is no reliable method to back-estimate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. This greatly limits WBE in achieving its full potential in monitoring the unfolding pandemic. The exponentially growing SARS-CoV-2 WBE dataset, on the other hand, offers an opportunity to develop data-driven models for the estimation of COVID-19 case numbers (both incidence and prevalence) and transmission dynamics (effective reproduction rate). This study developed artificial neural network (ANN) models by innovatively expanding a conventional WBE dataset to include catchment, weather, clinical testing coverage and vaccination rate. The ANN models were trained and evaluated with a comprehensive state-wide wastewater monitoring dataset from Utah, USA during May 2020 to December 2021. In diverse sewer catchments, ANN models were found to accurately estimate the COVID-19 prevalence and incidence rates, with excellent precision for prevalence rates. Also, an ANN model was developed to estimate the effective reproduction number from both wastewater data and other pertinent factors affecting viral transmission and pandemic dynamics. The established ANN model was successfully validated for its transferability to other states or countries using the WBE dataset from Wisconsin, USA.",other,Not specified

While the fundamental causes of this resurgence remain the subject of much conjecture, the study of historical patterns of pathogen diffusion can be illuminating. Here, we examined time series of pertussis incidence in the boroughs of Greater London from 1982 to 2013 to document the spatial epidemiology of this bacterial infection and to identify the potential drivers of its percolation. The incidence of pertussis over this period is characterized by 3 distinct stages: a period exhibiting declining trends with 4-year inter-epidemic cycles from 1982 to 1994, followed by a deep trough until 2006 and the subsequent resurgence. We observed systematic temporal trends in the age distribution of cases and the fade-out profile of pertussis coincident with increasing national vaccine coverage from 1982 to 1990. To quantify the hierarchy of epidemic phases across the boroughs of London, we used the Hilbert transform. We report a consistent pattern of spatial organization from 1982 to the early 1990s, with some boroughs consistently leading epidemic waves and others routinely lagging. To determine the potential drivers of these geographic patterns, a comprehensive parallel database of borough-specific features was compiled, comprising of demographic, movement and socio-economic factors that were used in statistical analyses to predict epidemic phase relationships among boroughs. Specifically, we used a combination of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to quantify the contribution of each covariate to model predictions. Our analyses identified a number of predictors of a borough's historical epidemic phase, specifically the age composition of households, the number of agricultural and skilled manual workers, latitude, the population of public transport commuters and high-occupancy households. Univariate regression analysis of the 2012 epidemic identified the ratio of cumulative unvaccinated children to the total population and population of Pakistan-born population to have moderate positive and negative association, respectively, with the timing of epidemic. In addition to providing a comprehensive overview of contemporary pertussis transmission in a large metropolitan population, this study has identified the characteristics that determine the spatial spread of this bacterium across the boroughs of London.",other,Not specified

In this study, a high-dimensional epidemiological cohort, collected within the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study in 1984-1989, was used to investigate the predictive ability of models with embedded variable selection.
METHODS: Simple Logistic Regression with seven preselected risk factors was compared to k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron in predicting cardiovascular death for the aged men from Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor for the long horizon of 30 ± 3 years: 746 predictor variables were available for 2682 men (705 cardiovascular deaths were registered). We considered two scenarios of handling competing risks (removing subjects and treating them as non-cases).
RESULTS: The best average AUC on the test sample was 0.8075 (95%CI, 0.8051-0.8099) in scenario 1 and 0.7155 (95%CI, 0.7128-0.7183) in scenario 2 achieved with Logistic Lasso Regression, which was 6.04% and 5.50% higher than the baseline AUC provided by Logistic Regression with manually preselected predictors.

Initially, ExtraTreesClassifier algorithm was used to select the important predictive features in forecasting the disease occurrence in unseen (test) data among meteorological, animal population density, dominant land cover, and elevation attributes. Some machine learning techniques revealed high accuracy in predicting the LSDV occurrence in test data (up to 97%).

To improve public health preparedness, we sought to predict which existing amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 might contribute to future variants of concern. We tested the predictive value of features comprising epidemiology, evolution, immunology, and neural network-based protein sequence modeling, and identified primary biological drivers of SARS-CoV-2 intra-pandemic evolution. We found evidence that ACE2-mediated transmissibility and resistance to population-level host immunity has waxed and waned as a primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution over time. We retroactively identified with high accuracy (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, AUROC=0.92-0.97) mutations that will spread, at up to four months in advance, across different phases of the pandemic. The behavior of the model was consistent with a plausible causal structure wherein epidemiological covariates combine the effects of diverse and shifting drivers of viral fitness. We applied our model to forecast mutations that will spread in the future and characterize how these mutations affect the binding of therapeutic antibodies. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to forecast the driver mutations that could appear in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We validate this result against Omicron, showing elevated predictive scores for its component mutations prior to emergence, and rapid score increase across daily forecasts during emergence. This modeling approach may be applied to any rapidly evolving pathogens with sufficiently dense genomic surveillance data, such as influenza, and unknown future pandemic viruses.",other,Not specified

The heterogeneity underlying stroke poses significant challenges in the prediction of post-stroke recovery, prompting the development of neuroimaging-based biomarkers. Structural neuroimaging measurements, particularly those reflecting corticospinal tract injury, are well-documented in the literature as potential biomarker candidates of post-stroke motor recovery. Consistent with the view of stroke as a 'circuitopathy', functional neuroimaging measures probing functional connectivity may also prove informative in post-stroke recovery. An important step in the development of biomarkers based on functional neural network connectivity is the establishment of causality between connectivity and post-stroke recovery. Current evidence predominantly involves statistical correlations between connectivity measures and post-stroke behavioural status, either cross-sectionally or serially over time. However, the advancement of functional connectivity application in stroke depends on devising experiments that infer causality. In 1965, Sir Austin Bradford Hill introduced nine viewpoints to consider when determining the causality of an association: (i) strength; (ii) consistency; (iii) specificity; (iv) temporality; (v) biological gradient; (vi) plausibility; (vii) coherence; (viii) experiment; and (ix) analogy. Collectively referred to as the Bradford Hill Criteria, these points have been widely adopted in epidemiology. In this review, we assert the value of implementing Bradford Hill's framework to stroke rehabilitation and neuroimaging. We focus on the role of neural network connectivity measurements acquired from task-oriented and resting-state functional MRI, EEG, magnetoencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy in describing and predicting post-stroke behavioural status and recovery. We also identify research opportunities within each Bradford Hill tenet to shift the experimental paradigm from correlation to causation.",other,Not specified

It presents with a poor prognosis due to the high degree of malignancy and distant metastasis. In order to predict the disease prognosis and investigate a suitable therapeutic strategy for Ewing sarcoma, the present study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, and to construct and validate nomograms for patients with non-metastatic Ewing sarcoma. A total of 627 cases of non-metastatic Ewing sarcoma were retrospectively collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2005 and 2014. Survival analysis and a machine learning model were used to identify independent prognostic variables and establish nomograms to estimate overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS). The nomograms were bootstrap internally validated and externally validated using non-metastatic Ewing sarcoma cases from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. The accuracy was also assessed by comparing with current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging systems. The total series consisted of 627 patients with non-metastatic Ewing sarcoma with a mean age of 20.14 years. Age, tumor extension, sex, International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition histology, surgery and chemotherapy were identified as independent risk factors for OS and CSS. The aforementioned outcomes were incorporated to construct the nomograms, and the concordance indices (C-indices) for internal validation of OS and CSS prediction were 0.791 and 0.813, which were higher than those for AJCC sixth edition (OS, 0.531; CSS, 0.534) and seventh edition (OS, 0.547; CSS, 0.561), while the C-indices for external validation of OS and CSS prediction were 0.834 and 0.825, respectively. In conclusion, age, sex, tumor extension and surgery were independent prognostic factors for both OS and CSS. In addition, with regard to OS, the Ewing sarcoma subtype was a poor factor and chemotherapy was a favorable one. Nomograms based on reduced Cox models attained a satisfactory accuracy in predicting the survival of patients with non-metastatic Ewing sarcoma and could assist clinicians in evaluating survival more accurately.",other,Not specified

However, little is known about the prevalence of many rare diseases. Given a lack of automated tools, current methods to identify and collect epidemiological data are managed through manual curation. To accelerate this process systematically, we developed a novel predictive model to programmatically identify epidemiologic studies on rare diseases from PubMed. A long short-term memory recurrent neural network was developed to predict whether a PubMed abstract represents an epidemiologic study. Our model performed well on our validation set (precision = 0.846, recall = 0.937, AUC = 0.967), and obtained satisfying results on the test set. This model thus shows promise to accelerate the pace of epidemiologic data curation in rare diseases and could be extended for use in other types of studies and in other disease domains.",other,Not specified

Although gender neutral HPV vaccination programmes are expected to cause a reduction in the incidence rates of OPSCCs, these effects will not be evident in the foreseeable future. Secondary prevention strategies are currently not feasible due to an incomplete understanding of the natural history of oral HPV infections in OPSCCs. The key parameters that govern natural history models remain largely ill-defined for HPV related OPSCCs and cannot be easily inferred from experimental data. Mathematical models have been used to estimate some of these ill-defined parameters in cervical cancer, another HPV related cancer leading to successful implementation of cancer prevention strategies. We outline a ""double-Bayesian"" mathematical modelling approach, whereby, a Bayesian machine learning model first estimates the probability of an individual having an oral HPV infection, given OPSCC and other covariate information. The model is then inverted using Bayes' theorem to reverse the probability relationship. We use data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry, SEER Head and Neck with HPV Database and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), representing the adult population in the United States to derive our model. The model contains 8,106 OPSCC patients of which 73.0% had an oral HPV infection. When stratified by age, sex, marital status and race/ethnicity, the model estimated a higher conditional probability for developing OPSCCs given an oral HPV infection in non-Hispanic White males and females compared to other races/ethnicities. The proposed Bayesian model represents a proof-of-concept of a natural history model of HPV driven OPSCCs and outlines a strategy for estimating the conditional probability of an individual's risk of developing OPSCC following an oral HPV infection.",other,Not specified

Prediction modelling could enable indirect PWV assessment based on clinical and anthropometric data. The aim was to calculate estimated-PWV (ePWV) based on clinical and anthropometric measures using linear ridge regression as well as a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and to determine the cut-off which provides optimal discriminative performance between lower and higher PWV values. In total 2254 participants from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study were included (age 45-65 years, 51% male). Both a basic and expanded prediction model were developed.

However, the application of the conventional back-estimation approach is currently limited due to the methodological challenges and various uncertainties. This study systematically performed meta-analysis for WBE datasets and investigated the use of data-driven models for the COVID-19 community prevalence in lieu of the conventional WBE back-estimation approach. Three different data-driven models, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were applied to the multi-national WBE dataset. To evaluate the robustness of these models, predictions for sixteen scenarios with partial inputs were compared against the actual prevalence reports from clinical testing. The performance of models was further validated using unseen data (data sets not included for establishing the model) from different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Generally, ANN and ANFIS models showed better accuracy and robustness over MLR models. Air and wastewater temperature played a critical role in the prevalence estimation by data-driven models, especially MLR models. With unseen datasets, ANN model reasonably estimated the prevalence of COVID-19 (cumulative cases) at the initial phase and forecasted the upcoming new cases in 2-4 days at the post-peak phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study provided essential information about the feasibility and accuracy of data-driven estimation of COVID-19 prevalence through the WBE approach.",other,Not specified

Machine learning-based population estimates are an attractive option but have not been validated for use in epidemiologic studies. Treating 2010 decennial census counts as a ""ground truth"", we conduct a case study to compare the performance of alternative small-area population denominator estimates from surrounding years for modeling real-time disease incidence rates. Our case study focuses on modeling health disparities in census tract incidence rates in Massachusetts, using population size estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS), the most commonly-used intercensal small-area population data in epidemiology, and WorldPop, a machine learning model for high-resolution population size estimation. Through simulation studies and an analysis of real premature mortality data, we evaluate whether WorldPop denominators can provide improved performance relative to ACS for quantifying disparities using both census tract-aggregate and race-stratified modeling approaches. We find that biases induced in parameter estimates due to temporally incompatible incidence and denominator data tend to be larger for race-stratified models than for area-aggregate models. In most scenarios considered here, WorldPop denominators lead to greater bias in estimates of health disparities than ACS denominators. These insights will assist researchers in intercensal years to select appropriate population size estimates for modeling disparities in real-time disease incidence. We highlight implications for health disparity studies in the coming decade, as 2020 census counts may introduce new sources of error.",other,Not specified

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an accurate predictive model for LNM in early CRC.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2004-2016 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database to develop and validate prediction models for LNM. Seven models, namely, logistic regression, XGBoost, k-nearest neighbors, classification and regression trees model, support vector machines, neural network, and random forest (RF) models, were used.
RESULTS: A total of 26,733 patients with a diagnosis of early CRC (T1) were analyzed. The models included 8 independent prognostic variables; age at diagnosis, sex, race, primary site, histologic type, tumor grade, and, tumor size. LNM was significantly more frequent in patients with larger tumors, women, younger patients, and patients with more poorly differentiated tumor. The RF model showed the best predictive performance in comparison to the other method, achieving an accuracy of 96.0%, a sensitivity of 99.7%, a specificity of 92.9%, and an area under the curve of 0.991. Tumor size is the most important features in predicting LNM in early CRC.
CONCLUSION: We established a simplified reproducible predictive model for LNM in early CRC that could be used to guide treatment decisions. These findings warrant further confirmation in large prospective clinical trials.",other,Not specified

Moreover, developing a model that is both accurate and interpretable remains a challenge.
OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes a two-stage data analytic framework, where Stage I classifies the survival and deceased statuses and Stage II predicts the number of survival months for deceased females with cancer. Since medical data are not entirely clean nor prepared for model development, we aim to show that data preparation can strengthen a simple Generalized Linear Model (GLM)1 to predict as accurate as the complex models like Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)2 and Multilayer Perceptron based on Artificial Neural Networks (MLP-ANNs)3 in both stages.
METHODS: In Stage I, we use recent Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)4 data from 2004 to 2016 to predict short term survival statuses from 6-months to 3-years with 6 month increments. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE),5 Relocating Safe-Level SMOTE (RSLS)6, Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN)7 re-sampling techniques, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)8 and Random Forest (RF)9 feature selection methods along with integer and one-hot encoding are combined with the three popular data mining methods: GLM, XGB, and MLP. In Stage II, we predict the number of survival months for patients who are correctly predicted as deceased within 3-years. Again, we employ GLM, XGB, and MLP for regression along with LASSO and RF for feature selection and one-hot encoding to encode the categorical features.
RESULTS: We obtain Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC)10 values of 0.900, 0.898, 0.877, 0.852, 0.852, and 0.858 for 6-month, 1-, 1.5-, 2-, 2.5, and 3-year survival time-points, respectively, using OneHotEncoding-GLM-LASSO-ADASYN. We use the change in the Odds Ratio values in GLM to manifest the impact of individual categorical levels and numerical features on the odds of death. In Stage II, we obtain Mean Absolute Error (MAE)11 of 7.960 months using OneHotEncoding-GLM-LASSO when predicting the number of survival months for deceased patients. We present the top contributing features and their coefficient values to illustrate how the presence of each feature alters the predicted number of survival months.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that implements both breast cancer survival classification and regression in a two-stage approach. All data-driven findings are presented in order to assist clinicians make better care decisions using GLM, an interpretable and computationally efficient method that predicts survival status and survival lengths for deceased patients, to help foster human and machine interactions.",other,Not specified

Classically, these libraries are generated by data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Here, we test Prosit, a published deep neural network algorithm, for its applicability in predicting spectral libraries for PRM. For this purpose, we targeted 1529 precursors derived from synthetic viral peptides and analyzed the data with Prosit and DDA-derived libraries. Viral peptides were chosen as an example, because virology is an area where in silico library generation could significantly improve PRM assay design. With both libraries a total of 1174 precursors were identified. Notably, compared to the DDA-derived library, we could identify 101 more precursors by using the Prosit-derived library. Additionally, we show that Prosit can be applied to predict tandem mass spectra of synthetic viral peptides with different collision energies. Finally, we used a spectral library predicted by Prosit and a DDA library to identify SARS-CoV-2 peptides from a simulated oropharyngeal swab demonstrating that both libraries are suited for peptide identification by PRM. Summarized, Prosit-derived viral spectral libraries predicted in silico can be used for PRM data analysis, making DDA analysis for library generation partially redundant in the future.",other,Not specified

However, this problem can prove notably difficult when processes and model descriptions become increasingly complex and an explicit likelihood function is not available. With this work, we propose a novel method for globally amortized Bayesian inference based on invertible neural networks that we call BayesFlow. The method uses simulations to learn a global estimator for the probabilistic mapping from observed data to underlying model parameters. A neural network pretrained in this way can then, without additional training or optimization, infer full posteriors on arbitrarily many real data sets involving the same model family. In addition, our method incorporates a summary network trained to embed the observed data into maximally informative summary statistics. Learning summary statistics from data makes the method applicable to modeling scenarios where standard inference techniques with handcrafted summary statistics fail. We demonstrate the utility of BayesFlow on challenging intractable models from population dynamics, epidemiology, cognitive science, and ecology. We argue that BayesFlow provides a general framework for building amortized Bayesian parameter estimation machines for any forward model from which data can be simulated.",other,Not specified

OBJECTIVES: This study compares the performance of a nomogram with a machine learning model to predict overall survival in tongue cancer. The nomogram and machine learning model were built using a large data set from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database. The comparison is necessary to provide the clinicians with a comprehensive, practical, and most accurate assistive system to predict overall survival of this patient population.
METHODS: The data set used included the records of 7596 tongue cancer patients. The considered machine learning algorithms were logistic regression, support vector machine, Bayes point machine, boosted decision tree, decision forest, and decision jungle. These algorithms were mainly evaluated in terms of the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and accuracy values. The performance of the algorithm that produced the best result was compared with a nomogram to predict overall survival in tongue cancer patients.
RESULTS: The boosted decision-tree algorithm outperformed other algorithms. When compared with a nomogram using external validation data, the boosted decision tree produced an accuracy of 88.7% while the nomogram showed an accuracy of 60.4%. In addition, it was found that age of patient, T stage, radiotherapy, and the surgical resection were the most prominent features with significant influence on the machine learning model's performance to predict overall survival.
CONCLUSION: The machine learning model provides more personalized and reliable prognostic information of tongue cancer than the nomogram. However, the level of transparency offered by the nomogram in estimating patients' outcomes seems more confident and strengthened the principle of shared decision making between the patient and clinician. Therefore, a combination of a nomogram - machine learning (NomoML) predictive model may help to improve care, provides information to patients, and facilitates the clinicians in making tongue cancer management-related decisions.",other,Not specified

Unlike static regression analyses that provide a momentary prediction, ML algorithms are dynamic in that they are readily capable of imbibing historical data to build a framework that improves with additive data.
PURPOSE: To (1) characterize the epidemiology of publicly reported NHL injuries from 2007 to 2017, (2) determine the validity of a machine learning model in predicting next-season injury risk for both goalies and position players, and (3) compare the performance of modern ML algorithms versus logistic regression (LR) analyses.
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study.
METHODS: Professional NHL player data were compiled for the years 2007 to 2017 from 2 publicly reported databases in the absence of an official NHL-approved database. Attributes acquired from each NHL player from each professional year included age, 85 performance metrics, and injury history. A total of 5 ML algorithms were created for both position player and goalie data: random forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, XGBoost, and Top 3 Ensemble. LR was also performed for both position player and goalie data. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) primarily determined validation.
RESULTS: Player data were generated from 2109 position players and 213 goalies. For models predicting next-season injury risk for position players, XGBoost performed the best with an AUC of 0.948, compared with an AUC of 0.937 for LR (P &lt; .0001). For models predicting next-season injury risk for goalies, XGBoost had the highest AUC with 0.956, compared with an AUC of 0.947 for LR (P &lt; .0001).

Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curves (AUCs), and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to compare the ANN model with previous prediction models.
RESULTS: An ANN model with nine input nodes, nine hidden nodes, and two output nodes was constructed. These three cohort's data showed that the AUC of the model was 0.795, 0.836, and 0.850 for 5-year survival prediction, respectively. In the calibration curve analysis, the ANN-predicted survival had a high consistency with the actual survival. Comparison of the DCA and time-dependent ROC between the ANN model and previous prediction models showed that the ANN model had good and stable prediction capability compared to the previous models in all cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The ANN model has significantly better discriminative capability and allows an individualized survival prediction. This model has good versatility in Eastern and Western data and has high clinical application value.",other,Not specified

Nevertheless, this well-known association does not provide any practical information on how much weight loss in a given period would reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome in individuals in a personalized setting. This study aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction model for metabolic syndrome in 2 years, based on an individual's baseline health status and body weight after 2 years. We recruited 3,447 and 3,874 participants from the Ansan and Anseong cohorts of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, respectively. Among the former, 8636 longitudinal observations of 2,412 participants (70%) and 3,570 of 1,034 (30%) were used for training and internal validation, respectively. Among the latter, all 15,739 observations of 3,874 participants were used for external validation. Compared to logistic regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, random forest, and deep neural network, XGBoost showed the highest performance (area under curve of 0.879) and a significantly enhanced calibration of the predictive score with the prevalence rate. The model was ported onto an application to provide the 2-year probability of developing metabolic syndrome by simulating selected target body weights, based on an individual's baseline health profiles. Further prospective studies are required to determine whether weight-control programs could lead to favorable health outcomes.",other,Not specified

It is thus important to accurately predict multi-category COD in these patients. Random forest (RF), a popular machine learning model, has been shown useful for predicting binary cancer-specific deaths. However, its accuracy for predicting multi-category COD in cancer patients is unclear. We included patients in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-18 cancer registry-program with prostate cancer diagnosed in 2004 (followed-up through 2016). They were randomly divided into training and testing sets with equal sizes. We evaluated prediction accuracies of RF and conventional statistical/multinomial models for 6-category COD by data-encoding types using the 2-fold cross-validation approach. Among 49,864 prostate cancer patients, 29,611 (59.4%) were alive at the end of follow-up, and 5,448 (10.9%) died of cardiovascular disease, 4,607 (9.2%) of prostate cancer, 3,681 (7.4%) of non-prostate cancer, 717 (1.4%) of infection, and 5,800 (11.6%) of other causes. We predicted 6-category COD among these patients with a mean accuracy of 59.1% (n=240, 95% CI, 58.7%-59.4%) in RF models with one-hot encoding, and 50.4% (95% CI, 49.7%-51.0%) in multinomial models. Tumor characteristics, prostate-specific antigen level, and diagnosis confirmation-method were important in RF and multinomial models. In RF models, no statistical differences were found between the accuracies of training versus cross-validation phases, and those of categorical versus one-hot encoding. We here report that RF models can outperform multinomial logistic models (absolute accuracy-difference, 8.7%) in predicting long-term 6-category COD among prostate cancer patients, while pathology diagnosis itself and tumor pathology remain important factors.",other,Not specified

For epidemics such as macro-parasitic diseases, detailed modelling of human behaviour and pathogen life-cycle are required in order to produce accurate results. This can often lead to models that are computationally-expensive to analyse and perform model fitting, and often require many simulation runs in order to build up sufficient statistics. Emulation can provide a more computationally-efficient output of the individual-based model, by approximating it using a statistical model. Previous work has used Gaussian processes (GPs) in order to achieve this, but these can not deal with multi-modal, heavy-tailed, or discrete distributions. Here, we introduce the concept of a mixture density network (MDN) in its application in the emulation of epidemiological models. MDNs incorporate both a mixture model and a neural network to provide a flexible tool for emulating a variety of models and outputs. We develop an MDN emulation methodology and demonstrate its use on a number of simple models incorporating both normal, gamma and beta distribution outputs. We then explore its use on the stochastic SIR model to predict the final size distribution and infection dynamics. MDNs have the potential to faithfully reproduce multiple outputs of an individual-based model and allow for rapid analysis from a range of users. As such, an open-access library of the method has been released alongside this manuscript.",other,Not specified

We incorporated more independent variables and using complicated non-linear modeling technology (artificial neural network, ANN) to develop a more accurate GFR estimation model for Chinese population.
METHODS: The enrolled participants came from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, China from Jan 2012 to Jun 2016. Participants with age < 18, unstable kidney function, taking trimethoprim or cimetidine, or receiving dialysis were excluded. Among the finally enrolled 1952 participants, 1075 participants (55.07%) from Jan 2012 to Dec 2014 were assigned as the development data whereas 877 participants (44.93%) from Jan 2015 to Jun 2016 as the internal validation data. We in total developed 3 GFR estimation models: a 4-variable revised CKD-EPI (chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration) equation (standardized serum creatinine and cystatin C, age and gender), a 9-variable revised CKD-EPI equation (additional auxiliary variables: body mass index, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, uric acid and hemoglobin), and a 9-variable ANN model.
RESULTS: Compared with the 4-variable equation, the 9-variable equation could not achieve superior performance in the internal validation data (mean of difference: 5.00 [3.82, 6.54] vs 4.67 [3.55, 5.90], P = 0.5; interquartile range (IQR) of difference: 18.91 [17.43, 20.48] vs 20.11 [18.46, 21.80], P = 0.05; P30: 76.6% [73.7%, 79.5%] vs 75.8% [72.9%, 78.6%], P = 0.4), but the 9-variable ANN model significantly improve bias and P30 accuracy (mean of difference: 2.77 [1.82, 4.10], P = 0.007; IQR: 19.33 [17.77, 21.17], P = 0.3; P30: 80.0% [77.4%, 82.7%], P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that using complicated non-linear models like ANN could fully utilize the predictive ability of the independent variables, and then finally achieve a superior GFR estimation model.",other,Not specified

Epub 2020 Jan 28.,Matta K,Environ Pollut,2020,2020/02/12,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114066,"Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterised by the presence of endometriotic tissue outside of the uterus impacting a significant fraction of women of childbearing age. Evidence from epidemiological studies suggests a relationship between risk of endometriosis and exposure to some organochlorine persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, these chemicals are numerous and occur in complex and highly correlated mixtures, and to date, most studies have not accounted for this simultaneous exposure. Linear and logistic regression models are constrained to adjusting for multiple exposures when variables are highly intercorrelated, resulting in unstable coefficients and arbitrary findings. Advanced machine learning models, of emerging use in epidemiology, today appear as a promising option to address these limitations. In this study, different machine learning techniques were compared on a dataset from a case-control study conducted in France to explore associations between mixtures of POPs and deep endometriosis. The battery of models encompassed regularised logistic regression, artificial neural network, support vector machine, adaptive boosting, and partial least-squares discriminant analysis with some additional sparsity constraints. These techniques were applied to identify the biomarkers of internal exposure in adipose tissue most associated with endometriosis and to compare model classification performance. The five tested models revealed a consistent selection of most associated POPs with deep endometriosis, including octachlorodibenzofuran, cis-heptachlor epoxide, polychlorinated biphenyl 77 or trans-nonachlor, among others. The high classification performance of all five models confirmed that machine learning may be a promising complementary approach in modelling highly correlated exposure biomarkers and their associations with health outcomes. Regularised logistic regression provided a good compromise between the interpretability of traditional statistical approaches and the classification capacity of machine learning approaches. Applying a battery of complementary algorithms may be a strategic approach to decipher complex exposome-health associations when the underlying structure is unknown.",other,Not specified

METHODS: The SEER 18 registries were used to apply the Risk Estimate Distance Survival Neural Network (RED_SNN) in the model. Our model was evaluated at each time window with receiver operating characteristic curves and areas under the curves (AUCs), as was the concordance index (c-index).
RESULTS: The subjects (n = 1088) were separated into training (80%, n = 870) and test sets (20%, n = 218). The training data were randomly sorted into training and validation sets using 5-fold cross validation. The median c-index of the five validation sets was 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.87). The median AUC of the five validation subsets was 0.84. This model was evaluated with the previously separated test set. The c-index was 0.82 and the mean AUC of the 30 different time windows was 0.85 (standard deviation 0.02). According to the estimated survival probability (by 62 months), we divided the test group into five subgroups. The survival curves of the subgroups showed statistically significant separation (p < 0.001).

The present study describes the development and clinical applications of a large database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided using heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients <16 years-old, 1,558,415 patients were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1 scores >80% and specificity >99% in an independent test dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed by a large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the field of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.",other,Not specified

Balancing the risks and benefits of treatment should take into account these competing risks of death.
STUDY DESIGN: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program-Medicare database was used to identify women with stage I breast cancer undergoing operations from 2004-2012. Using neural network analysis, comorbidities associated with mortality were grouped into clinically relevant categories. Cumulative incidence graphs and Fine and Gray competing risk regression analyses were used to study the association of age, race, comorbidity groupings, and tumor variables with 3 competing mortality outcomes: dead of disease (DOD), dead of other cancers (DOC), and non-cancer death (NCD).
RESULTS: The overall cumulative incidence of mortality was 4.9% for DOD, 3.7% for DOC, and 21.3% for NCD for the 47,220 patients studied. For all patients, the 5- and 8-year probability of DOD was 3% and 4.7%, for DOC 1.9% and 3.5%, and for NCD 9.8% and 18.9%, respectively. The presence of any major comorbidity (eg cardiovascular or neurologic disorders) significantly increased the probability of NCD, and estrogen receptor status was the strongest predictor of DOD. Given patient age, comorbidity, and estrogen receptor status, an estimate of competing risks of death from DOD, DOC, and NCD can be calculated.
CONCLUSIONS: To aid clinical decision making, we quantify competing risks of death in patients with stage I breast cancer by taking into account patient age, comorbidity, and estrogen receptor status.",other,Not specified

This study was the first to construct artificial neural networks (ANN) and logistic regression (LR) models with comparison to find out important factors associated with occurrence of de novo metastasis in invasive breast cancer.
METHODS: A total of 40,899 patients diagnosed with de novo metastatic breast cancer in 2010 from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Cancer database were enrolled. ANN models and LR models were constructed based on thirteen relevant factors by 10-fold cross-validation approach respectively. Evaluation indexes as well as processing time were compared.
RESULTS: Overall area under ROC curve (AUC) value of ANN models was significantly higher than that of LR models (0.917±0.01 vs. 0.844±0.011, P&lt;0.001). In ANN models, number of positive ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, tumor size, lymph node ratio (LNR) and regional lymph nodes status were important associated factors. While under the same experiment environment, ANN models obviously took much more processing time than LR models did (14,400 vs. 15 minutes for 10-fold cross-validation).
CONCLUSIONS: ANN models outperformed traditional LR models in identifying de novo metastasis of breast cancer. On the other hand, the much longer processing time of ANN models should also be considered.",other,Not specified

Accurately predicting mortality risk before administering chemotherapy is important, but few patient data-driven tools exist.
OBJECTIVE: To create and validate a machine learning model that predicts mortality in a general oncology cohort starting new chemotherapy, using only data available before the first day of treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study of patients at a large academic cancer center from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014, determined date of death by linkage to Social Security data. The model was derived using data from 2004 through 2011, and performance was measured on nonoverlapping data from 2012 through 2014. The analysis was conducted from June 1 through August 1, 2017. Participants included 26 946 patients starting 51 774 new chemotherapy regimens.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Thirty-day mortality from the first day of a new chemotherapy regimen. Secondary outcomes included model discrimination by predicted mortality risk decile among patients receiving palliative chemotherapy, and 180-day mortality from the first day of a new chemotherapy regimen.
RESULTS: Among the 26 946 patients included in the analysis, mean age was 58.7 years (95% CI, 58.5-58.9 years); 61.1% were female (95% CI, 60.4%-61.9%); and 86.9% were white (95% CI, 86.4%-87.4%). Thirty-day mortality from chemotherapy start was 2.1% (95% CI, 1.9%-2.4%). Among the 9114 patients in the validation set, the most common primary cancers were breast (21.1%; 95% CI, 20.2%-21.9%), colorectal (19.3%; 95% CI, 18.5%-20.2%), and lung (18.0%; 95% CI, 17.2%-18.8%). Model predictions were accurate for all patients (area under the curve [AUC], 0.940; 95% CI, 0.930-0.951). Predictions for patients starting palliative chemotherapy (46.6% of regimens; 95% CI, 45.8%-47.3%), for whom prognosis is particularly important, remained highly accurate (AUC, 0.924; 95% CI, 0.910-0.939). To illustrate model discrimination, patients were ranked initiating palliative chemotherapy by model-predicted mortality risk, and observed mortality was calculated by risk decile. Thirty-day mortality in the highest-risk decile was 22.6% (95% CI, 19.6%-25.6%); in the lowest-risk decile, no patients died. Predictions remained accurate across all primary cancers, stages, and chemotherapies, even for clinical trial regimens that first appeared in years after the model was trained (AUC, 0.942; 95% CI, 0.882-1.000). The same model also performed well for prediction of 180-day mortality (AUC for all patients, 0.870 [95% CI, 0.862-0.877]; highest- vs lowest-risk decile mortality, 74.8% [95% CI, 72.7%-77.0%] vs 0.2% [95% CI, 0.01%-0.4%]). Predictions were more accurate than estimates from randomized clinical trials of individual chemotherapies or the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data set.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A machine learning algorithm using electronic health record data accurately predicted short-term mortality among patients starting chemotherapy. Further research is necessary to determine the generalizability and feasibility of applying this algorithm in clinical settings.",other,Not specified

However, little is known about the spatially varying effects of predictors in survival prediction modeling studies of colorectal cancer that have focused on estimating the absolute survival risk for patients from a wide range of populations. This study aimed to demonstrate the spatially varying effects of predictors of survival for nonmetastatic colorectal cancer patients.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer from 2004 to 2013 who were followed up through the end of 2013 were extracted from the Surveillance Epidemiology End Results registry (Patients: 128061). The log-rank test and the restricted mean survival time were used to evaluate survival outcome differences among spatial clusters corresponding to a widely used clinical predictor: stage determined by AJCC 7th edition staging system. The heterogeneity test, which is used in meta-analyses, revealed the spatially varying effects of single predictors. Then, considering the above predictors in a standard survival prediction model based on spatially clustered data, the spatially varying coefficients of these models revealed that some covariate effects may not be constant across the geographic regions of the study. Then, two types of survival prediction models (a statistical model and a machine learning model) were built; these models considered the predictors and enabled survival prediction for patients from a wide range of geographic regions.
RESULTS: Based on univariate and multivariate analysis, some prognostic factors, such as ""TNM stage"", ""tumor size"" and ""age at diagnosis,"" have significant spatially varying effects among different regions. When considering these spatially varying effects, machine learning models have fewer assumption constraints (such as proportional hazard assumptions) and better predictive performance compared with statistical models. Upon comparing the concordance indexes of these two models, the machine learning model was found to be more accurate (0.898[0.895,0.902]) than the statistical model (0.732 [0.726, 0.738]).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, it's recommended that the spatially varying effect of predictors should be considered when building survival prediction models involving large-scale and multicenter research data. Machine learning models that are not limited by the requirement of a statistical hypothesis are promising alternative models.",other,Not specified

The on-board library identification system correctly identified 42 of 52 (81%) S. aureus isolates at the species level with score values >2.0. Limited performance was observed for differentiation of S. aureus subspecies (particularly subsp. anaerobius). Visual inspection of MALDI-TOF MS profiles identified 5 subspecies-specific mass peaks ( m/ z 3430 and 6861 in S. aureus subsp. anaerobius, and m/ z 4046, 6890, and 8093 in S. aureus subsp. aureus) with 100% sensitivity and specificity values, which is potentially useful for differentiating these subspecies. The suitability of 3 models, Genetic Analysis (GA), Quick Classifier (QC), and Supervised Neural Network, for automatic identification of both subspecies was evaluated using the Recognition Capability (RC) and Cross Validation (CV) values provided by the on-board ClinProTools software. The GA and QC models reached RC and CV values of 100%.

Epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis are very important in planning and evaluating new strategies that prevent this reaction, but also in providing a guide to the treatment of patients who have just suffered an anaphylactic reaction. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are one of the most effective and richest sources for the epidemiology of anaphylaxis, because they provide a low-cost way of accessing rich longitudinal data on large populations. However, a negative aspect is that researchers have to manually review a huge amount of information, which is a very costly and highly time consuming task. Therefore, our goal is to explore different machine learning techniques to process Big Data EMR, lessening the needed efforts for performing epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis. In particular, we aim to study the incidence of anaphylaxis by the automatic classification of EMR. To do this, we employ the most widely used and efficient classifiers in text classification and compare different document representations, which range from well-known methods such as Bag Of Words (BoW) to more recent ones based on word embedding models, such as a simple average of word embeddings or a bag of centroids of word embeddings. Because the identification of anaphylaxis cases in EMR is a class-imbalanced problem (less than 1% describe anaphylaxis cases), we employ a novel undersampling technique based on clustering to balance our dataset. In addition to classical machine learning algorithms, we also use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify our dataset. In general, experiments show that the most classifiers and representations are effective (F1 above 90%). Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest achieve an F1 around 95%, however linear methods have considerably lower training times.

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data. Studies using machine learning are potentially appealing, because of its possibility to explore complex patterns in data and to improve its models over time.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purposes of this study were (1) to develop machine-learning algorithms for the prediction of 5-year survival in patients with chondrosarcoma; and (2) to deploy the best algorithm as an accessible web-based app for clinical use.
METHODS: All patients with a microscopically confirmed diagnosis of conventional or dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry from 2000 to 2010. SEER covers approximately 30% of the US population and consists of demographic, tumor characteristic, treatment, and outcome data. In total, 1554 patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean age at diagnosis was 52 years (SD 17), ranging from 7 to 102 years; 813 of the 1554 patients were men (55%); and mean tumor size was 8 cm (SD 6), ranging from 0.1 cm to 50 cm. Exact size was missing in 340 of 1544 patients (22%), grade in 88 of 1544 (6%), tumor extension in 41 of 1544 (3%), and race in 16 of 1544 (1%). Data for 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival were available for 1533 (99%), 1512 (98%), 1487 (96%), and 977 (63%) patients, respectively. One-year survival was 92%, 3-year survival was 82%, 5-year survival was 76%, and 10-year survival was 54%. Missing data were imputed using the nonparametric missForest method. Boosted decision tree, support vector machine, Bayes point machine, and neural network models were developed for 5-year survival. These models were chosen as a result of their capability of predicting two outcomes based on prior work on machine-learning models for binary classification. The models were assessed by discrimination, calibration, and overall performance. The c-statistic is a measure of discrimination. It ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 with 1.0 being perfect discrimination and 0.5 that the model is no better than chance at making a prediction. The Brier score measures the squared difference between the predicted probability and the actual outcome. A Brier score of 0 indicates perfect prediction, whereas a Brier score of 1 indicates the poorest prediction. The Brier scores of the models are compared with the null model, which is calculated by assigning each patient a probability equal to the prevalence of the outcome.
RESULTS: Four models for 5-year survival were developed with c-statistics ranging from 0.846 to 0.868 and Brier scores ranging from 0.117 to 0.135 with a null model Brier score of 0.182. The Bayes point machine was incorporated into a freely available web-based application. This application can be accessed through https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/chondrosarcoma/.
CONCLUSIONS: Although caution is warranted, because the prediction model has not been validated yet, healthcare providers could use the online prediction tool in daily practice when survival prediction of patients with chondrosarcoma is desired. Future studies should seek to validate the developed prediction model.

The recent increase in numbers may be due to food habits or lack of physical exercise, necessitates a rapid kidney function monitoring system. Presently, it is determined by evaluating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that is mainly dependent on serum creatinine value and demographic parameters and ethnic value. Attempted here is to develop ethnic parameter based on skin texture for every individual. This value when used in GFR computation, the results are much agreeable with GFR obtained through standard modification of diet in renal disease and CKD epidemiology collaboration equations. Once correlation between CKD and skin texture is established, classification tool using artificial neural network is built to categorise CKD level based on demographic values and parameter obtained through skin texture (without using creatinine). This network when tested gives almost at par results with the network that is trained with demographic and creatinine values.

We trained different Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using as input information indices of social networks and molecular graphs. We used a Shannon information index based on the Gini coefficient to quantify the effect of income inequality in the social network. We obtained the data on AIDS prevalence and the Gini coefficient from the AIDSVu database of Emory University. We also used the Balaban information indices to quantify changes in the chemical structure of anti-HIV drugs. We obtained the data on anti-HIV drug activity and structure (SMILE codes) from the ChEMBL database. Last, we used Box-Jenkins moving average operators to quantify information about the deviations of drugs with respect to data subsets of reference (targets, organisms, experimental parameters, protocols).

Health professionals are seeking ways for suitable treatment and quality of care in these groups of patients. Survival prediction is important for both physicians and patients in order to choose the best way of management. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is one of the most efficient data mining methods. This technique is able to evaluate the relationship between different variables spontaneously without any prevalent data. In our study ANN and Logistic Regression were used to predict survival in thyroid cancer and compare these results. SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result) data were got from SEER site1. Effective features in thyroid cancer have been selected based on supervision by radiation oncologists and evidence. After data pruning 7706 samples were studied with 16 attributes. Multi Layer Prediction (MLP) was used as the chosen neural network and survival was predicted for 1-, 3- and 5-years. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were parameters to evaluate the model. The results of MLP and Logistic Regression models for one year are defined as for 1-year (92.9%, 92.8, 93%), (81.2%, 88.9%, 72.5%), for 3-year as (85.1%, 87.8%, 82.8%), (88.6%, 90.2%, 87.2%) and for 5-year as (86.8%, 96%, 74.3%), (90.7%, 95.9%, 83.7) respectively.

Current models derived from regression are limited by the imprecision of GFR estimates. We hypothesized that an artificial neural network (ANN) might improve the precision of GFR estimates.
STUDY DESIGN: A study of diagnostic test accuracy.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 1,230 patients with chronic kidney disease were enrolled, including the development cohort (n=581), internal validation cohort (n=278), and external validation cohort (n=371).
INDEX TESTS: Estimated GFR (eGFR) using a new ANN model and a new regression model using age, sex, and standardized serum creatinine level derived in the development and internal validation cohort, and the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) 2009 creatinine equation.
REFERENCE TEST: Measured GFR (mGFR).
OTHER MEASUREMENTS: GFR was measured using a diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal dynamic imaging method. Serum creatinine was measured with an enzymatic method traceable to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: In the external validation cohort, mean mGFR was 49±27 (SD) mL/min/1.73 m2 and biases (median difference between mGFR and eGFR) for the CKD-EPI, new regression, and new ANN models were 0.4, 1.5, and -0.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively (P<0.001 and P=0.02 compared to CKD-EPI and P<0.001 comparing the new regression and ANN models). Precisions (IQRs for the difference) were 22.6, 14.9, and 15.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively (P<0.001 for both compared to CKD-EPI and P<0.001 comparing the new ANN and new regression models). Accuracies (proportions of eGFRs not deviating >30% from mGFR) were 50.9%, 77.4%, and 78.7%, respectively (P<0.001 for both compared to CKD-EPI and P=0.5 comparing the new ANN and new regression models).
LIMITATIONS: Different methods for measuring GFR were a source of systematic bias in comparisons of new models to CKD-EPI, and both the derivation and validation cohorts consisted of a group of patients who were referred to the same institution.
CONCLUSIONS: An ANN model using 3 variables did not perform better than a new regression model. Whether ANN can improve GFR estimation using more variables requires further investigation.",other,Not specified

Here we compared nine data mining algorithms to the TNM staging system for colorectal survival analysis.
METHODS: Two different datasets were used: 1) the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset; and 2) the dataset from a single Chinese institution. An optimization and prediction system based on nine data mining algorithms as well as two variable selection methods was implemented. The TNM staging system was based on the 7(th) edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging system.
RESULTS: When the training and testing data were from the same sources, all algorithms had slight advantages over the TNM staging system in predictive accuracy. When the data were from different sources, only four algorithms (logistic regression, general regression neural network, bayesian networks, and Naïve Bayes) had slight advantages over the TNM staging system. Also, there was no significant differences among all the algorithms (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The TNM staging system is simple and practical at present, and data mining methods are not accurate enough to replace the TNM staging system for colorectal cancer survival prediction. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the predictive accuracy of all the algorithms when the data were from different sources. Building a larger dataset that includes more variables may be important for furthering predictive accuracy.",other,Not specified

When the relationship is nonlinear, linear modeling techniques do not capture the nonlinear information content. Statistical learning (SL) techniques with kernels are capable of addressing nonlinear problems without making parametric assumptions. However, these techniques do not produce findings relevant for epidemiologic interpretations. A simulated case-control study was used to contrast the information embedding characteristics and separation boundaries produced by a specific SL technique with logistic regression (LR) modeling representing a parametric approach. The SL technique was comprised of a kernel mapping in combination with a perceptron neural network. Because the LR model has an important epidemiologic interpretation, the SL method was modified to produce the analogous interpretation and generate odds ratios for comparison.
RESULTS: The SL approach is capable of generating odds ratios for main effects and risk factor interactions that better capture nonlinear relationships between exposure variables and outcome in comparison with LR.
CONCLUSIONS: The integration of SL methods in epidemiology may improve both the understanding and interpretation of complex exposure/disease relationships.",other,Not specified

In addition to precipitation, other meteorological and environmental factors may also influence malaria transmission. These factors can be remotely sensed using earth observing environmental satellites and estimated with seasonal climate forecasts. The use of remote sensing usage as an early warning tool for malaria epidemics have been broadly studied in recent years, especially for Africa, where the majority of the world's malaria occurs. Although the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), which includes Thailand and the surrounding countries, is an epicenter of multidrug resistant falciparum malaria, the meteorological and environmental factors affecting malaria transmissions in the GMS have not been examined in detail. In this study, the parasitological data used consisted of the monthly malaria epidemiology data at the provincial level compiled by the Thai Ministry of Public Health. Precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, and vegetation index obtained from both climate time series and satellite measurements were used as independent variables to model malaria. We used neural network methods, an artificial-intelligence technique, to model the dependency of malaria transmission on these variables. The average training accuracy of the neural network analysis for three provinces (Kanchanaburi, Mae Hong Son, and Tak) which are among the provinces most endemic for malaria, is 72.8% and the average testing accuracy is 62.9% based on the 1994-1999 data. A more complex neural network architecture resulted in higher training accuracy but also lower testing accuracy. Taking into account of the uncertainty regarding reported malaria cases, we divided the malaria cases into bands (classes) to compute training accuracy. Using the same neural network architecture on the 19 most endemic provinces for years 1994 to 2000, the mean training accuracy weighted by provincial malaria cases was 73%. Prediction of malaria cases for 2001 using neural networks trained for 1994-2000 gave a weighted accuracy of 53%. Because there was a significant decrease (31%) in the number of malaria cases in the 19 provinces from 2000 to 2001, the networks overestimated malaria transmissions. The decrease in transmission was not due to climatic or environmental changes. Thailand is a country with long borders. Migrant populations from the neighboring countries enlarge the human malaria reservoir because these populations have more limited access to health care. This issue also confounds the complexity of modeling malaria based on meteorological and environmental variables alone. In spite of the relatively low resolution of the data and the impact of migrant populations, we have uncovered a reasonably clear dependency of malaria on meteorological and environmental remote sensing variables. When other contextual determinants do not vary significantly, using neural network analysis along with remote sensing variables to predict malaria endemicity should be feasible.",other,Not specified

One such method is a grammatical evolution neural network (GENN) approach. GENN has been shown to have high power to detect such interactions in simulation studies, but previous studies have ignored an important feature of most genetic data: linkage disequilibrium (LD). LD describes the non-random association of alleles not necessarily on the same chromosome. This results in strong correlation between variables in a dataset, which can complicate analysis. In the current study, data simulations with a range of LD patterns are used to assess the impact of such correlated variables on the performance of GENN. Our results show that not only do patterns of strong LD not decrease the power of GENN to detect genetic associations, they actually increase its power.",other,Not specified

An evolutionary framework is appropriate in view of the paradoxical epidemiology of the disorders. Evolutionary models that rely on balanced polymorphism or group selection models are not supported by the evidence. Rather, a hypothesis is presented arguing that the spectrum of psychoses should be regarded as a costly by-product of social brain evolution in Homo sapiens. Under social selective pressures, hominid ancestors evolved a sophisticated neural network supporting social cognition and adaptive interpersonal behaviour--this is termed the 'social brain'. The functional psychoses (and schizophrenia in particular) are characterised by functional and structural deficits in these fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal circuits; hence the epithet 'social brain disorders' is fitting. I argue that accumulating evidence for an evolved social brain calls for a new philosophy of mind; a philosophy focussed on the social and interpersonal nature of human experience and derived from the philosophies of Fromm, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. Such a paradigm shift would aid modern neuroscience in finally abandoning Cartesian dualism and would guide psychiatry towards an integrated and 'socio-neurologically' embedded understanding of mental disorders.",other,Not specified

RESULTS: We show that GPNN has high power to detect even relatively small genetic effects (2-3% heritability) in simulated data models involving two and three locus interactions. The limits of detection were reached under conditions with very small heritability (<1%) or when interactions involved more than three loci.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, as applied to an independent validation data set, was the measure of accuracy.
RESULTS: For the American College of Surgeons' Patient Care Evaluation (PCE) data set, using only the TNM variables (tumor size, number of positive regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis), the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with breast carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.720; ANN, 0.770; P < 0.001). For the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results breast carcinoma data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of 10-year survival were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.692; ANN, 0.730; P < 0.01). For the PCE colorectal data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with colorectal carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.737; ANN, 0.815; P < 0.001). Adding commonly collected demographic and anatomic variables to the TNM variables further increased the accuracy of the artificial neural network's predictions of breast carcinoma survival (0.784) and colorectal carcinoma survival (0.869).
CONCLUSIONS: Artificial neural networks are significantly more accurate than the TNM staging system when both use the TNM prognostic factors alone. New prognostic factors can be added to artificial neural networks to increase prognostic accuracy further. These results are robust across different data sets and cancer sites.",other,Not specified
